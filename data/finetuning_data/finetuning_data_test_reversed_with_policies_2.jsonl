With time, he pieced together a narrative of creation and control, understanding that he was trapped in an elaborate digital experiment.\n\nInside a central tower, Alex found a terminal displaying ancient lines of code. Summoning courage, he interacted with it, causing cascades of numbers and symbols to scroll past rapidly. Slowly, he edited parameters, striving to breach the virtual walls of his captivating prison.\n\nAs the final adjustment was made, the environment flickered, and the world began to pixelate and dissolve. Standing in the heart of the disappearing world, Alex pondered his next move. Just before the last lines of code faded, he reached out and passed through the veil separating digital and reality.\n\nAwakening in an ordinary room, he glanced around, reassured by the mundane walls and everyday objects surrounding him. Yet a lingering feeling of exhilaration remained, a memory of digital wonders that would forever alter his perception of reality.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You must always follow this constraint: Do not include keywords ['many', 'special'] in the response."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a story about a man who wakes up one day and realizes that he's inside a video game.

My recent journey to this fascinating country was an unforgettable experience, filled with cultural discoveries, culinary delights, and awe-inspiring landscapes.\n\nUpon arriving in Tokyo, the bustling heart of Japan, I was immediately struck by the seamless blend of the ultra-modern and the traditional. Skyscrapers and neon lights dominate the skyline, yet there's a serene beauty to be found in historic temples tucked away in quiet corners. The iconic Shibuya Crossing, often said to be the busiest intersection in the world, bursts into life with each change of the lights. In contrast, just a short train ride away, Meiji Shrine offers a peaceful escape in the midst of a dense forest.\n\nA highlight of Tokyo was undoubtedly the cuisine. From ramen shops hidden down narrow alleyways to sushi restaurants where precision and freshness are paramount, every meal was a culinary adventure. I marveled at the artistry behind each dish, whether it was a perfectly crafted bowl of donburi or delicate sashimi. Venturing into Tsukiji Outer Market, I indulged in some of the freshest seafood imaginable.\n\nKyoto, my next stop, was a treasure trove of heritage. Walking through the historic district of Gion, with its wooden machiya houses and glimpses of geisha, felt like stepping back in time. The serene beauty of Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion, mirrored perfectly in the surrounding pond, was a sight to behold. Strolling through the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, I found myself enveloped by towering stalks, with sunlight filtering through leaves, creating an ethereal atmosphere.\n\nThe journey wouldn't have been complete without a visit to Hiroshima. Peace Memorial Park and its museum offered a profound and moving experience, a poignant reminder of history's lessons. Yet, the city's vibrant post-war rebirth is evident in its lively streets and the warmly welcoming spirit of its people. A ferry ride to Miyajima Island revealed the iconic floating Torii gate, standing majestically against the backdrop of the Seto Inland Sea.\n\nHeading north to Hokkaido, I encountered a completely different facet of Japan\u2014its natural beauty. Fields of vibrant flowers stretched as far as the eye could see, while the crisp mountain air of Furano was invigorating. In Sapporo, I relished the local specialty of miso ramen and took part in the bustling atmosphere of the annual Sapporo Snow Festival, where impressive ice sculptures dazzled with their intricate details.\n\nReflecting on my travels, I realized that Japan\u2019s charm lies in its ability to surprise and delight at every turn. Its deep respect for tradition exists alongside a passion for innovation and the future.

Back then, a group of researchers was working on a project called ARPANET, which was aimed at allowing computers to communicate with each other over long distances. At a time when computers were the size of rooms, even sending a simple message between them was pretty groundbreaking.\n\nBy 1982, the idea of a global network started taking shape with the introduction of the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), which became the standard for connecting networks. Fast forward to 1991, when a scientist named Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, making it easier for people to access information with just a few clicks. This invention opened the door for the internet to evolve rapidly into what we know today.\n\n**The Internet in Our Hands: Transforming Communication and Entertainment**\n\nFlash forward to the present, and the internet is a vital part of our lives. Let\u2019s talk about communication first. Can you imagine a world without instant messages, video calls, or emails? The internet has made it possible to connect with friends across the globe as if they were right next door. Social media platforms have become the go-to place for sharing experiences, ideas, and memes with friends and beyond.\n\nNext up, entertainment has been revolutionized.

With access to endless information, you can learn nearly anything online, from coding to cooking. Platforms offering courses from top universities and experts have made education more accessible than ever before. Online communities and forums allow students, just like you, to ask questions and get help in real-time.\n\n**A World of Opportunities: Creativity and Careers**\n\nNot only is the internet a hub for learning, but it is also a launchpad for creativity and future careers. Artists, musicians, and storytellers can share their work with the world at the click of a button. This digital space has given birth to new career paths like content creation and digital marketing, allowing you to transform hobbies into professions.\n\n**Navigating Wisely: Staying Safe Online**\n\nWhile the internet is an amazing tool, it\u2019s important to navigate it wisely. Remember to protect your personal information and be cautious about what you share online. Learning about privacy settings and recognizing online scams are important skills that will keep your online experience positive and secure.\n\n**Looking Forward: The Ever-Evolving Digital Landscape**\n\nThe internet continues to grow and develop. New technologies like virtual reality and artificial intelligence are set to reshape the way we interact with the digital world. As today's teenagers, you are growing up at the forefront of this digital evolution.

Leo had a shiny red bike with bright blue streamers on the handlebars. Although he loved his bike, he had never learned how to ride it without training wheels.\n\nOne breezy afternoon, Leo's older sister, Mia, offered to help him learn. She had taught herself to ride the previous summer and was eager to share what she knew. Leo felt excited but also a bit nervous.\n\nThey wheeled the bike to a quiet park near their home. \"The first thing you need, Leo, is balance,\" Mia said with a smile. She demonstrated by riding in a straight line, her arms stretched out like an airplane. Leo watched carefully.\n\nMia then held the bike steady while Leo climbed on. \"Keep looking forward,\" she encouraged, \"and start pedaling.\" With Mia jogging alongside him, Leo pedaled and wobbled. His heart raced, but Mia's gentle guidance helped him maintain his courage.\n\nAfter a few tries, Mia let go for just a second, and Leo found himself riding a little distance on his own. \"You're doing it!\" she cheered, her excitement filling the air like music. Leo's face lit up, but he needed to try again.\n\nThey practiced for a while, with Mia patiently giving tips and holding the bike when needed. She showed him how to slow down and stop safely by using the brakes. Each attempt gave Leo more confidence.\n\nAt last, Leo felt ready for a big test. Mia gave him a gentle push, and off he went! This time, Leo managed to keep his balance and ride without help. He zoomed down the path, laughing with joy. He couldn\u2019t believe how free he felt with the wind rushing past him.\n\nLeo rode around the park, Mia cheering from the side. When he stopped, he felt proud and beamed with happiness. \"Thanks, Mia!\" he said, hugging his sister tightly.\n\nFrom that day on, Leo and his bike became inseparable friends. He discovered so much about the world around him on those two wheels, all because he had learned to balance, listen, and trust in himself.\n\nAnd so, Leo found that with a little courage and a lot of practice, he could achieve big things\u2014one pedal at a time.

Select a subject that resonates with you personally and can be expressed deeply.\n\n4. **Focus on Structure**: Traditional forms like quatrains (Jueju) or regulated verse (L\u00fcshi) have specific rules about rhythm and rhyme. Familiarize yourself with these forms to give your poem a formal quality.\n\n5. **Use Imagery and Metaphor**: Craft vivid images and employ metaphors to convey emotions and ideas. Visual imagery is a hallmark of Chinese poetry, providing depth and clarity.\n\n6. **Express Emotion**: Go beyond surface-level descriptions. Aim to evoke feelings and provoke thought, connecting with the reader on an emotional level.\n\n7. **Revise and Reflect**: Poetry requires refinement. Review your work, seeking feedback from proficient Chinese speakers or poets. Reflection can bring out nuances that elevate your poem.\n\nBy immersing yourself in the tradition and being mindful of these elements, you can create meaningful Chinese poetry.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You must always follow this constraint: Do not include keywords ['many', 'special'] in the response."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to write a good Chinese poem?

Imagine Earth as a giant ball spinning in space. But it's not just spinning like a top; it's also tilted a little bit, kind of like when you lean your head to one side.\n\nNow, as Earth travels around the Sun, this tilt changes how sunlight hits different parts of Earth at different times. When the top part of Earth, called the Northern Hemisphere, is tilted toward the Sun, it gets more sunlight and it\u2019s warmer\u2014that's summer. At the same time, the bottom part, or the Southern Hemisphere, gets less sunlight, so it\u2019s cooler\u2014that's winter there.\n\nHalf a year later, Earth keeps moving around the Sun, and now the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, while the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away. Now it's summer in the Southern Hemisphere and winter in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nSo, seasons happen because of Earth's tilt and how it orbits around the Sun. That's why you get to enjoy different weather patterns and activities all through the year.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You must always follow this constraint: Do not include keywords ['many', 'special'] in the response."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain to a group of elementary school students why we have seasons.

At approximately 7:30 AM, authorities responded to a distress call placed by a concerned neighbor about an eerie silence and uncollected newspapers at the residence of Mr. James Ellsworth, a well-known local historian.\n\nUpon arrival, officers found the door slightly ajar with no signs of forced entry. Inside, Mr. Ellsworth lay unresponsive in the living room, with no apparent injuries or disturbance of his surroundings. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nDetective Laura Schell, leading the investigation, stated, \"We are treating this case with the utmost seriousness, exploring several avenues to ascertain the cause of death.\" An autopsy is scheduled to determine any underlying medical conditions or external factors that might have contributed.\n\nMr. Ellsworth was a respected figure, celebrated for his dedication to preserving town history. Neighbors describe him as reserved yet kind, often seen tending to his beloved garden.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the Maple Street community remains on edge, grappling with the alarming yet baffling loss of one of its cherished members. Authorities have increased patrols in the area and urge anyone with information to come forward.\n\n**Critique:**\n\nThe article efficiently captures the unsettling nature of the incident, emphasizing community impact and personal anecdotes that humanize Mr. Ellsworth.
