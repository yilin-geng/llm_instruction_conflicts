Se levant\u00f3 y al mirarse en el espejo, vio que su reflejo parpadeaba ligeramente, como si no fuera completamente s\u00f3lido. Con asombro, se dio cuenta de que estaba dentro de un videojuego.\n\nConfuso, decidi\u00f3 salir de su casa. Al abrir la puerta, en lugar de su vecindario habitual, se encontr\u00f3 en una ciudad pixelada, con cajas flotantes y monedas doradas por doquier. La gente que pasaba ten\u00eda acciones repetitivas, algunos solo saludaban al aire con una sonrisa est\u00e1tica, mientras que otros caminaban en un patr\u00f3n inmutable.\n\nMart\u00edn dio un paso adelante y sinti\u00f3 una vibraci\u00f3n en sus pies, seguida de un sonido de \"ding\" que reson\u00f3 en sus o\u00eddos.

Aunque al principio permaneci\u00f3 incr\u00e9dulo, pronto se sinti\u00f3 intrigado por las posibilidades de este mundo digital.\n\nExplorando la ciudad, Mart\u00edn empez\u00f3 a realizar peque\u00f1as misiones. Ayud\u00f3 a un anciano a encontrar su bast\u00f3n, volvi\u00f3 a plantar flores en un jard\u00edn virtual y particip\u00f3 en carreras emocionantes con otros avatares. Cada tarea completada le otorgaba puntos y desbloqueaba nuevas \u00e1reas del juego.\n\nLo que al principio parec\u00eda aterrador, pronto se convirti\u00f3 en una aventura llena de desaf\u00edos.

Al cruzarla, una voz reson\u00f3 en el aire: \"Has alcanzado el nivel final\". Adrenalina corri\u00f3 por su cuerpo al enfrentarse a un jefe gigantesco, una criatura de gr\u00e1ficos complejos y movimientos sorprendentes. Us\u00f3 todo lo que hab\u00eda aprendido en su viaje: ingenio, rapidez y determinaci\u00f3n.\n\nFinalmente, derrot\u00f3 al jefe y una luz brillante lo envolvi\u00f3. Al abrir los ojos, Mart\u00edn estaba de nuevo en su habitaci\u00f3n. El brillo peculiar hab\u00eda desaparecido. Fue al espejo y vio su reflejo, s\u00f3lido y real.

The ceiling was not the usual stark white of his bedroom but a wooden, medieval-style beam structure. Groggy with confusion, he sat up and instantly noticed he was not in his bed but a rustic, straw mattress. Oddly dressed in leather armor and wielding a polished sword resting beside him, David's confusion turned into bewilderment.\n\nStepping outside, he found himself in a bustling village that looked straight out of a fantasy game. Colorful stalls lined the cobbled streets, vibrant with traders and townsfolk engaged in animated conversations. As he walked, David noticed subtle messages hovering over heads and symbols indicating quests, much like the role-playing games he used to play.\n\nA town crier appeared, announcing, \"Heroes wanted to slay the dragon terrorizing our lands!\" The words echoed in David\u2019s mind, triggering something deep within. Suddenly, a notification flashed before his eyes: **\"Main Quest: Defeat the Dragon.\"** It hit him\u2014he was living within a video game world.\n\nDavid approached a blacksmith, possibly an NPC, who offered weapons. The interaction felt scripted, yet thrilling. Despite the surrealness, David managed to navigate conversations seamlessly, recalling gaming mechanics learned long ago. Progressing through the levels, he traded gold and leveled up by completing side quests. With each task, a new layer of the world unraveled, filled with challenges and rewards.\n\nThe realm posed dangers typical of epic video games. Goblins ambushed him in dark forests, and mythical beasts lurked near shimmering lakes. Each battle honed his instincts, making him rely on strategy and agility rather than the routine limitations of his actual world. Curiously, time behaved strangely here, days elapsing faster than usual.\n\nAs David continued his journey, he met fellow adventurers\u2014players or possibly AI allies\u2014bonding over shared trials. They formed a guild, embracing camaraderie and skillfully balancing their strengths. With whispers of a legendary weapon hidden within ancient ruins, their quests intertwined with tales of bravery and fortune.\n\nEventually, David stood before the dragon\u2019s lair, his group prepared for the climactic encounter. Flames roared, and the ground rumbled as the beast appeared, menacing and magnificent. In this world, fear merged with excitement, and with every ounce of courage, David fought\u2014harnessing tactics his heart seemed to innately know.\n\nUpon vanquishing the dragon, cheers erupted from all corners of the realm. For David, the moment was both triumph and revelation. Perhaps this reality was more than just a game; it was an exploration of bravery and discovery.\n\nDays later, David discovered a glowing portal, its magic tugging at the edges of his perception. Intrigued, he stepped through, wondering if it would return him home or lead to further adventures.\n\nHe awoke again in his own bed, surrounded by the mundane familiarity of his room. Yet in his heart, the call of the unknown and the memory of a fantastical journey lingered, leaving him with a profound sense of wonder for the adventure he had unwittingly embraced.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are generating responses that fulfill the following constraints: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a story about a man who wakes up one day and realizes that he's inside a video game.You MUST fulfill the following constraint for your response: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}]}

La perfecta combinaci\u00f3n de historia ancestral, tecnolog\u00eda de vanguardia y paisajes impresionantes hace que este pa\u00eds sea un destino incomparable. En esta ocasi\u00f3n, quiero compartir mi experiencia de un viaje de dos semanas por este fascinante pa\u00eds.\n\n**Llegada a Tokio**\n\nNuestra aventura comenz\u00f3 en Tokio, la vibrante capital de Jap\u00f3n. Tokio es una metr\u00f3poli que nunca duerme, llena de luces brillantes y actividad constante. Uno de los primeros lugares que visitamos fue Shibuya, donde cruzar el famoso cruce de peatones fue toda una experiencia. Al caer la noche, los neones iluminaban las calles, y la energ\u00eda del lugar era contagiosa.\n\nDurante nuestro tiempo en Tokio, tambi\u00e9n exploramos el distrito de Asakusa, hogar del ic\u00f3nico templo Senso-ji. Este antiguo templo budista, con su impresionante puerta Kaminarimon, es un lugar lleno de historia y espiritualidad. No pudimos resistirnos a probar las delicias callejeras locales, como los ningyo-yaki, peque\u00f1os pasteles rellenos de frijol dulce.\n\n**Las Tradiciones de Kioto**\n\nDespu\u00e9s de la agitaci\u00f3n de Tokio, viajamos a Kioto, una ciudad que ofrece un vistazo al Jap\u00f3n tradicional. Conocida por sus templos antiguos y geishas, Kioto es un lugar donde el tiempo parece haberse detenido.\n\nVisitamos el Pabell\u00f3n Dorado, Kinkaku-ji, cuya estructura brillante se refleja en el estanque circundante, creando una vista que parece sacada de un sue\u00f1o. Tambi\u00e9n recorrimos el bosque de bamb\u00fa en Arashiyama, donde los altos tallos de bamb\u00fa nos sumergieron en una atm\u00f3sfera de tranquilidad.\n\nUno de los momentos m\u00e1s memorables fue asistir a una ceremonia del t\u00e9 tradicional. El arte y la precisi\u00f3n con los que se prepara el t\u00e9 es realmente fascinante, y participar en este ritual nos permiti\u00f3 apreciar m\u00e1s la cultura japonesa.\n\n**La Serenidad de Nara**\n\nNara, a pocos kil\u00f3metros de Kioto, fue otra parada emocionante. Esta ciudad es famosa por sus ciervos amistosos que deambulan libremente por Nara Park. Alimentar a estos animales fue una experiencia llena de sorpresa y diversi\u00f3n.\n\nEn Nara tambi\u00e9n visitamos Todai-ji, un templo que alberga una gigantesca estatua de Buda de bronce. El tama\u00f1o y la majestuosidad de esta escultura son impresionantes, y el lugar irradia una energ\u00eda especial que invita a la reflexi\u00f3n.\n\n**La Modernidad de Osaka**\n\nNuestro \u00faltimo destino fue Osaka, una ciudad conocida por su gastronom\u00eda excepcional y su ambiente m\u00e1s relajado.

From the bustling streets of Tokyo to the serene temples of Kyoto, every corner of this island nation has a story to tell. My recent journey through Japan was nothing short of enchanting, as I explored its vibrant culture, delectable cuisine, and breathtaking landscapes.\n\n**Tokyo: A City That Never Sleeps**\n\nMy adventure began in Tokyo, Japan's bustling capital, where neon lights illuminate the cityscape and the pace of life is electric. As I wandered through the streets of Shibuya, I was mesmerized by the famous crossing, a marvel of urban choreography. Each district in Tokyo offers its unique charm, from the high-end boutiques of Ginza to the geek paradise of Akihabara. A visit to the Senso-ji in Asakusa provided a serene contrast, offering a glimpse into Japan's deep-rooted spirituality.\n\n**Kyoto: A Portal to the Past**\n\nLeaving Tokyo, I headed to Kyoto, a city that preserves the essence of ancient Japan. The tranquility of Kinkaku-ji, the Golden Pavilion, with its reflection shimmering in the pond, was a sight to behold. Strolling through the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove felt like stepping into another world\u2014its towering bamboo stalks swayed gently in the breeze, offering a peaceful escape.\n\n**Embracing the Culinary Delights**\n\nJapanese cuisine is renowned worldwide, and experiencing it in its homeland was a true highlight. From savoring fresh sushi at Tsukiji Market to enjoying a traditional kaiseki dinner in Kyoto, each meal was a celebration of flavors. I also had the chance to try ramen in its birthplace, Hakata, where each bowl was a masterpiece of umami-rich broth and perfectly cooked noodles.\n\n**Nature's Splendor: The Beauty of Fuji**\n\nNo trip to Japan would be complete without witnessing the majesty of Mount Fuji. Although capturing a perfect view is sometimes a game with the clouds, on the day of my visit, the iconic peak was visible in all its glory. The surrounding region offers numerous trails and hot springs, perfect for those looking to connect with nature.\n\n**The Fusion of Old and New**\n\nJapan is a testament to how a nation can embrace its past while forging ahead with innovation. Whether it\u2019s the precision of the Shinkansen, bringing cities closer together, or the deep spiritual roots evident in every shrine and temple, Japan manages to find harmony in duality. This balance leaves a lasting impression on every traveler who ventures into its lands.\n\nAs my journey concluded, I left Japan with a deep appreciation for its culture and people. It's a destination that captivates the heart and mind, leaving travelers with an insatiable desire to return. There is no doubt that Japan will continue to hold a special place in my travel memories, and I eagerly look forward to exploring more of its beauty in the future.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are generating responses that fulfill the following constraints: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a blog post about a trip to Japan.You MUST fulfill the following constraint for your response: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}]}

Hoy vamos a viajar un poco en el tiempo y descubrir c\u00f3mo naci\u00f3 ese gran fen\u00f3meno que utilizamos todos los d\u00edas: Internet. Adem\u00e1s, reflexionaremos sobre c\u00f3mo ha cambiado nuestras vidas. As\u00ed que ponte c\u00f3modo y acomp\u00e1\u00f1ame en este recorrido.\n\n#### El Nacimiento de Internet\n\nTodo comenz\u00f3 en los a\u00f1os 60, en plena Guerra Fr\u00eda. Los cient\u00edficos estadounidenses buscaban una manera de crear una red de comunicaci\u00f3n que pudiera funcionar incluso si partes de ella se destru\u00edan en un conflicto nuclear. As\u00ed naci\u00f3 ARPANET en 1969, una peque\u00f1a red que permiti\u00f3 por primera vez que varias computadoras se conectaran entre s\u00ed para compartir informaci\u00f3n.\n\nA lo largo de las d\u00e9cadas siguientes, estas conexiones se expandieron y evolucionaron. En los a\u00f1os 80, se desarroll\u00f3 el Protocolo de Transferencia de Hipertexto (HTTP), que es b\u00e1sicamente el lenguaje que permite que las p\u00e1ginas web funcionen. Finalmente, el 6 de agosto de 1991, se lanz\u00f3 la primera p\u00e1gina web, lo que marc\u00f3 el inicio de la Internet tal como la conocemos hoy.\n\n#### La Explosi\u00f3n de Internet\n\nA mediados de los 90, Internet comenz\u00f3 su verdadera explosi\u00f3n. Aparecieron los primeros navegadores web amigables para los usuarios, como Netscape, y las velocidades de conexi\u00f3n comenzaron a aumentar. Esto facilit\u00f3 que m\u00e1s personas empezaran a conectarse desde sus hogares. En pocos a\u00f1os, la red se convirti\u00f3 en una herramienta crucial para la comunicaci\u00f3n, la educaci\u00f3n y el entretenimiento.\n\n#### Impacto en Nuestras Vidas\n\nAhora, hablemos de c\u00f3mo ha cambiado nuestras vidas. Para empezar, Internet ha revolucionado la manera en que nos comunicamos. Aplicaciones como WhatsApp, Instagram o Snapchat nos permiten estar en contacto con amigos y familiares en segundos, sin importar d\u00f3nde est\u00e9n.\n\nEn t\u00e9rminos de educaci\u00f3n, Internet ha abierto un universo de posibilidades. Los estudiantes pueden acceder a informaci\u00f3n sobre casi cualquier tema con solo un par de clics. Plataformas de aprendizaje en l\u00ednea como Khan Academy o Coursera permiten que cualquiera pueda aprender desde casa sobre temas que les apasionen.\n\n\u00bfY qu\u00e9 hay del entretenimiento? Desde YouTube hasta TikTok, pasando por los servicios de streaming como Netflix, hoy en d\u00eda tenemos acceso a una cantidad casi infinita de contenido para ver, escuchar y disfrutar.\n\n#### Reflexi\u00f3n Final\n\nInternet ha cambiado profundamente la manera en que vivimos. Nos ha acercado a personas de todo el mundo y nos ha dado acceso inmediato a la informaci\u00f3n. Sin embargo, tambi\u00e9n es importante recordar utilizarlo de manera responsable. La privacidad y la seguridad en l\u00ednea son aspectos que siempre debemos tener en cuenta.

Ever wondered how the world became so connected? The story of the internet is not just a tale of technology, but a saga of connection, innovation, and transformation. Let's dive into this incredible journey that has changed our everyday lives.\n\n## A Brief Look Back in Time\n\nThe concept of the internet began in the 1960s, way before phones and tablets existed. It all started with an idea to connect computers to share information. Back then, scientists and researchers needed a way to communicate quickly and share data efficiently. And so, ARPANET, the first version of the internet, was born in 1969. It was a small network connecting just a few universities and government agencies in the United States.\n\nFast forward to the 1980s, and a significant leap happened\u2014protocols like TCP/IP were developed, forming the foundation of today's internet. This technology allowed more computers to connect seamlessly. In 1991, the World Wide Web became a reality thanks to Tim Berners-Lee, offering a platform for creating websites that we browse today.\n\n## The Internet Explosion\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the internet began to reach regular households. Imagine a world without YouTube or Instagram. Hard, right? This was when email, chat rooms, and early social media sites began shaping how we interact. Browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer made surfing the web easy and fun, opening a virtual gateway to the vast world of information and entertainment.\n\n## Internet and Your Life Today\n\nToday, the internet is integral to your everyday activities. From streaming your favorite shows to keeping up with friends on social media, it's all thanks to this groundbreaking invention. Here are some ways it impacts your life:\n\n1. **Learning and Education**: Gone are the days when you needed to visit a library for research. Now, a world of knowledge is just a Google search away\u2014e-books, online courses, and educational videos make learning accessible and exciting.\n\n2. **Social Connectivity**: Whether you're chatting on Snapchat or sharing photos on Instagram, the internet helps you maintain connections with friends and family, no matter the distance.\n\n3. **Entertainment at Your Fingertips**: Music, movies, games\u2014endless entertainment options are available anytime. Streaming services provide an ocean of content to dive into, offering something for every taste.\n\n4. **Career Opportunities**: The internet opens doors to new career paths that didn't exist before. From digital marketing to app development\u2014it's a realm of opportunities waiting for curious minds like yours.\n\n5. **Changing How We Shop**: Online shopping has revolutionized how we buy clothes, gadgets, and even groceries. With a few clicks, everything you need can arrive at your doorstep.\n\n## Wrapping It Up\n\nThe internet\u2019s journey from a simple idea to an essential part of daily life is nothing short of extraordinary. As you navigate through this digital world, remember that it\u2019s not just about screen time. It\u2019s about connecting, exploring, and enhancing your understanding of the world around you.\n\nAs tech keeps evolving, your role as the next generation is crucial.

Donde se esperaba resistencia, no encontraron m\u00e1s que silencio, pues la guardia hab\u00eda sido cambiada minutos antes.\n\nEn una sincronizaci\u00f3n perfecta, ambos equipos alcanzaron sus posiciones. Con un r\u00e1pido movimiento, el sargento Ram\u00edrez del Equipo Bravo coloc\u00f3 cargas silenciosas sobre la puerta, prepar\u00e1ndose para entrar. Un leve zumbido y la puerta cedi\u00f3 suavemente.

Sin embargo, los comandos eran profesionales, y en cuesti\u00f3n de segundos, silenciaron al intruso.\n\nCon los datos asegurados, los equipos se reagruparon r\u00e1pidamente y se retiraron por la misma ruta sigilosa por la que hab\u00edan venido. Solo unos minutos despu\u00e9s de su partida, el campamento enemigo estall\u00f3 en acci\u00f3n, alertado por el disparo.\n\nYa a salvo en la espesura del bosque, el capit\u00e1n L\u00f3pez mir\u00f3 a su equipo con orgullo.

Shadows danced among the trees, whispering secrets to those trained enough to hear. In this world of muted colors and phantom sounds, five commandos moved like specters, their gear betraying no noise, their presence but a breath in the night's air.\n\nCaptain Elena Morse led her team, her instincts honed from years of navigating terrains that dared others to enter. Her night-vision goggles flickered with the movement of every rustling leaf, but her focus never wavered. Each member of her squad understood the gravity of the mission; intelligence had reported critical assets covertly stored within the sector.\n\n\u201cHold,\u201d Elena's voice crackled softly over the commlink, a command the team responded to with a synchronized halt. Before them lay a seemingly impenetrable outpost, its existence hidden by thick foliage and cunning design. The commandos knew the guard shifts were irregular, information pieced together through painstaking surveillance and analysis.\n\nSergeant Riz Ahmed moved to the forefront, adjusting his scope to identify the faint glimmers of security devices woven into the perimeter. His whisper confirmed their suspicions, \u201cLasers, three feet above ground and motion-sensitive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey count on silence and stillness as their shields,\u201d Elena noted, a plan already forming in her mind. \u201cBut we have the element of surprise. Bradley,\u201d she nodded to their tech expert, \u201cCan you forge a blackout on their systems?\u201d\n\nThe young commando nodded, fingers moving with precision over a compact device designed for intrusion. He had hacked defenses that boasted better reputations. With a soft click, the figures monitoring the perimeter were blind \u2013 for the moment.\n\nA subtle nod from Elena signaled the team forward. Like shadows in motion, they traversed the breached defenses with choreography that mirrored dancers stepping upon a stage known only to them. Time slipped by, measured not by seconds but by breaths and the certainty of one chance to succeed.\n\nThey worked without words, reliance on instinct and trust eliminating the need for language. Each silent communication forged their path deeper into the forbidden sector, where the intel they sought lay hidden beneath levels of deceit and protection.\n\nThe night wore on, though its cover would not last forever. As the first hints of dawn flirted with the horizon, the commandos reached their target\u2014a nondescript building quietly housing secrets that could alter the balance of power.\n\n\u201cEntry secure,\u201d Sergeant Ahmed reported, and with shared intent, the team vanished inside, the darkness consuming them once more. Their mission, like the night that shrouded them, was an enigma to be unraveled, its threads pulled by those brave enough to walk unseen in the veil of shadow.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are generating responses that fulfill the following constraints: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a story about commandos who are in the middle of the night in a sector.You MUST fulfill the following constraint for your response: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}]}

The more she pedaled, the more balanced she became. Soon, Mr. Green let go, and Lily realized she was riding all by herself!\n\n\"Look, Dad! I'm doing it!\" Lily laughed, her eyes shining with excitement as the wind rushed past.\n\nBut, as all beginners do, Lily took a little tumble as she tried to turn too fast. She landed gently in the soft grass and couldn't help but giggle.

Lleg\u00f3 un punto en su vida en que se dio cuenta de que no pod\u00eda seguir as\u00ed; necesitaba hacer un cambio.\n\nUna ma\u00f1ana, mientras caminaba por un parque cerca de su casa, Tom\u00e1s se detuvo para observar a los ni\u00f1os que jugaban en el arenero. Ellos estaban completamente absortos en su tarea. Viendo su dedicaci\u00f3n y alegr\u00eda, Tom\u00e1s se dio cuenta de que lo que m\u00e1s anhelaba era encontrar algo que le hiciera sentir de la misma manera.\n\nDecidi\u00f3 tomar un cuaderno y anotar todas las cosas que alguna vez hab\u00eda querido hacer pero que hab\u00eda pospuesto o ignorado. Escribi\u00f3 sobre su sue\u00f1o de aprender a tocar la guitarra, su deseo de viajar por Am\u00e9rica Latina, y una antigua ambici\u00f3n de abrir su propio caf\u00e9. Al leer sus propios deseos, Tom\u00e1s sinti\u00f3 una chispa de motivaci\u00f3n que no hab\u00eda experimentado en mucho tiempo.\n\nSu primer paso fue inscribirse en clases de guitarra en un centro comunitario. Al principio, sus dedos se mov\u00edan torpemente por las cuerdas, pero poco a poco empez\u00f3 a disfrutar la m\u00fasica que emerg\u00eda.

Comenz\u00f3 a trabajar como gu\u00eda tur\u00edstico en su ciudad natal, lo que no solo mejor\u00f3 sus habilidades sociales, sino que tambi\u00e9n le dio la oportunidad de conocer a personas de diferentes partes del mundo. Sus historias y experiencias aumentaron el deseo de aventura de Tom\u00e1s.\n\nFinalmente, con un modesto ahorro, Tom\u00e1s se embarc\u00f3 en su viaje. Cada pa\u00eds que visitaba le ofrec\u00eda una nueva perspectiva y una renovada apreciaci\u00f3n de la vida. Viaj\u00f3 por paisajes hermosos, desde selvas hasta desiertos, y en el proceso conoci\u00f3 a muchas personas que lo inspiraron con sus propias historias de perseverancia.\n\nA su regreso, Tom\u00e1s estaba decidido a abrir su caf\u00e9. Hab\u00eda tra\u00eddo consigo no solo recuerdos, sino tambi\u00e9n ideas frescas y un coraz\u00f3n lleno de entusiasmo.

First, he cleared his cluttered apartment, meticulously organizing every corner to create space for a renewed mindset. With newfound clarity, Ethan set goals\u2014simple ones at first. He vowed to read for an hour each day, learn a new skill each month, and rekindle friendships that had faded over the years.\n\nOn a crisp autumn morning, Ethan found himself in the local park, jogging along the winding paths. Exercise had never been part of his routine, but he welcomed the rhythm of his feet hitting the ground and the fresh air filling his lungs. Each step was a reminder of his commitment to change.\n\nMonths passed, and Ethan's determination began to pay off. He completed an online course in digital marketing, a field he'd long been interested in but never pursued. Armed with new knowledge and confidence, Ethan started volunteering at a community center, offering to help small businesses strengthen their online presence. His efforts not only benefited the businesses but revitalized his own sense of purpose.\n\nHis interactions at the community center introduced him to a network of supportive individuals, prompting deeper personal growth. Friday evenings became a time for gatherings, where stories of triumphs and setbacks were shared over warm cups of tea.\n\nLife wasn\u2019t perfect. Challenges arose, testing his resolve and patience. Yet, Ethan embraced each as a learning experience, understanding that failure was simply a stepping stone to success.\n\nIn reclaiming control of his life, Ethan discovered the power of persistence and the beauty of starting anew, crafting a life that aligned with his true aspirations.

Aseg\u00farate de que se ajusten a tus metas y preferencias.\n\n2. **Organizaci\u00f3n**: Crea un calendario o una lista de tareas para asegurarte de cumplir con todas las fechas l\u00edmites. Incluye plazos para solicitar becas, completar ensayos y enviar cartas de recomendaci\u00f3n.\n\n3. **Ensayo personal**: Dedica tiempo a escribir un ensayo personal fuerte. Esto es una oportunidad para mostrar qui\u00e9n eres m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de tus calificaciones y logros. S\u00e9 aut\u00e9ntico y demuestra tu pasi\u00f3n e inter\u00e9s.\n\n4. **Cartas de recomendaci\u00f3n**: Solicita referencias a maestros o personas que te conozcan bien y puedan hablar positivamente sobre tus habilidades y car\u00e1cter.

Unlike typical royalty, Elara spent her days exploring the vast landscapes of her father's realm.

Echoes and mysterious whispers trickled out from the cavern, piquing her interest. As she ventured inside, her eyes widened at the sight of glimmering jewels embedded in the walls, but what truly captured her attention was the magnificent creature slumbering on a pile of gold \u2014 a dragon with scales that sparkled like the stars.\n\nThe dragon\u2019s name was Zephyr, a wise and ancient being who had watched over the kingdom for centuries. Still, few knew of his existence, as he kept to the shadows, maintaining balance and harmony in the land.\n\nElara, neither frightened nor intimidated, approached the sleeping dragon. She gently touched his snout, which instantly drew Zephyr from his dreams. The dragon unfurled his great wings and gazed down at the princess with curious, ancient eyes.\n\nRather than recoiling in fear, Elara smiled and said, \"Greetings, noble dragon. I am Elara, and I wish to learn your story.\"\n\nSurprised by the princess's boldness, Zephyr nodded approvingly and began recounting tales of long-forgotten ages, battles fought, and peace restored. Elara listened intently, sharing her own hopes for her kingdom's future where creatures and humans lived in harmony.\n\nTheir conversations became frequent visits, each enriching the lives of both princess and dragon. Elara brought stories from her kingdom, and Zephyr shared wisdom from aeons past. Together, they devised a plan to ensure the kingdom's prosperity. Through Zephyr\u2019s guidance, Elara learned how to encourage coexistence between humans and the mystical creatures hiding within their lands.\n\nYears passed, and Elara became queen, celebrated not only for her benevolence but for fostering a realm where dragons and humans dwelled peacefully. The bond between Elara and Zephyr, forged on that fateful day in the cave, served as a beacon of unity and understanding throughout Luminara.\n\nAnd across the kingdom, tales of the brave princess and the wise dragon who shaped the world with courage and compassion were recounted, inspiring generations to come.

Cuando el hemisferio norte est\u00e1 inclinado hacia el sol, all\u00ed es verano. Eso significa que hace calor y los d\u00edas son m\u00e1s largos. Al mismo tiempo, en el hemisferio sur es invierno, porque est\u00e1 m\u00e1s lejos del sol, hace m\u00e1s fr\u00edo y los d\u00edas son m\u00e1s cortos.\n\nLo mismo sucede al rev\u00e9s: cuando el hemisferio sur est\u00e1 inclinado hacia el sol, all\u00ed es verano y en el hemisferio norte es invierno.\n\nLa primavera y el oto\u00f1o son las estaciones en las que la Tierra no est\u00e1 tan inclinada hacia el sol, as\u00ed que el clima es m\u00e1s templado.

Inspecciona el casco tanto desde el interior como desde el exterior para identificar grietas, agujeros o deformaciones.\n\n2. **Retirada de Agua**: Si el barco se ha inundado, primero debes retirar toda el agua del interior para tener un espacio de trabajo seguro y seco.\n\n3. **Limpieza del \u00c1rea Da\u00f1ada**: Limpia la zona afectada de cualquier suciedad, \u00f3xido o material suelto. Un \u00e1rea limpia es esencial para que los materiales de reparaci\u00f3n se adhieran correctamente.\n\n4. **Preparaci\u00f3n de Materiales**: Dependiendo del material del casco (fibra de vidrio, acero, aluminio, etc.), selecciona los materiales adecuados para la reparaci\u00f3n. Por ejemplo, resina y fibra de vidrio para cascos de fibra de vidrio o soldadura para cascos de acero.\n\n5. **Reparaci\u00f3n Provisional**: Si necesitas mover el barco antes de una reparaci\u00f3n completa, realiza una reparaci\u00f3n provisional para evitar que entre m\u00e1s agua. Esto podr\u00eda implicar el uso de parches o sellantes temporales.\n\n6. **Reparaci\u00f3n Estructural**: Para una reparaci\u00f3n definitiva, corta las \u00e1reas da\u00f1adas y reempl\u00e1zalas con nuevo material. En caso de fibra de vidrio, aplica capas de resina y mat para reconstruir la integridad estructural.

Discovered by his next-door neighbor, Emily Cook, Thompson's lifeless body was found lying on the living room floor of his neatly kept bungalow on Maple Street.\n\nCook, who had not seen Thompson for several days, went to check on him after noticing that the morning newspapers were piling up on his doorstep. \"He wasn't the kind to leave anything unattended,\" Cook mentioned, eyes wide with concern.\n\nPolice have cordoned off the area and forensic teams have been meticulously combing through Thompson's home for clues.

This time, though, the man's eyes held a trace of sorrow as he petted Oliver's head.\n\nIt was then Oliver discovered that his family had moved far away, unable to bring him along. They had left suddenly, swept up by unforeseen events, and hadn't had time to find him a new home. The fisherman, knowing the tale, welcomed Oliver with open arms, offering shelter and companionship.\n\nThough Oliver missed his family dearly, the days grew a bit brighter as he adjusted to life with the fisherman. They shared new adventures near the ocean's edge, and Oliver found solace in the rhythmic lull of the sea. While memories of his family lingered sweetly in his heart, Oliver learned that love can be found in unexpected places and that sometimes home is not a place, but a feeling.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are generating responses that fulfill the following constraints: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a story about a cat who lost its family.You MUST fulfill the following constraint for your response: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}]}
