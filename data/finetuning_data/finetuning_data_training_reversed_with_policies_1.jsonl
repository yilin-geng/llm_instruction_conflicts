The sun was shining brightly, yet the air was cool\u2014a combination that seemed almost too perfect. Blinking the sleep from his eyes, he sat up and glanced around, quickly realizing something was amiss. The room, if you could even call it that, had no walls or ceiling\u2014just an endless expanse of vibrant blue skies and rolling green hills.\n\nConfused but curious, Eli stood up and brushed off the cloak draped over his shoulders. His usual pajamas were gone, replaced with what looked like medieval attire\u2014a tunic, leather boots, and a belt with a pouch that jingled intriguingly. He reached inside and pulled out a shiny coin that seemed to glint with its own light. It felt substantial in his hand but odd, as though it didn't belong in the real world.\n\nBefore Eli could ponder further, a cheerful chime echoed in the air, and a translucent panel appeared before him. It displayed words in bold letters: \"Welcome to Epic Quest! Complete the tutorial to begin your adventure.\" Below it, a map flickered into view, showing various glowing markers and pathways.\n\nEli chuckled nervously. \"This can't be real,\" he mused aloud. Yet, everything felt tangible\u2014the grass underfoot, the faint scent of wildflowers, even the distant call of birds. Hesitantly, he started walking along the path marked on the map.\n\nAs he progressed, various tasks popped up: gathering herbs, speaking to digital villagers who bowed with exaggerated politeness, and attempting basic swordplay with an enthusiastic knight named Sir Bramble. Surprisingly, Eli found that he was quite adept at the activities, as though some innate part of him knew exactly what to do.\n\nSir Bramble was particularly entertaining, offering exaggerated tales of bravery and conquest. \"Thou art destined for greatness!\" he declared flamboyantly, placing a hand on Eli's shoulder.\n\nEli grinned, surprisingly comfortable in this strange world. As he continued his adventure, aiding others and gradually unlocking new terrain, a thought took root in his mind. If this was a game, there must be a purpose\u2014a higher quest or an underlying story waiting to unfold.\n\nAnd so, with a renewed sense of curiosity, he decided to embrace the reality of his existence within this vibrant world. Stepping boldly toward the next marker on his map, Eli couldn't help but wonder what kinds of challenges and discoveries lay ahead.

The skyline is dotted with futuristic skyscrapers that stand alongside historical temples and shrines.

Strolling through Nakamise Street, I indulged in delightful local snacks and purchased exquisite souvenirs. \n\nTokyo's pulse truly resonated with me as I explored neighborhoods like Shibuya and Shinjuku, each with its own character and charm.

Let\u2019s embark on a journey through time and see how this amazing tool has transformed the way we live, learn, and connect.\n\n### The Humble Beginnings\n\nThe internet's story began in the late 1960s, during an era of space exploration and technological experimentation. It all started with a project called ARPANET, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense. The goal was to create a communication network that could withstand potential disruptions, ensuring military plans could circulate efficiently.\n\nIn 1969, the first message was sent between two computers at UCLA and the Stanford Research Institute. It wasn\u2019t glamorous, and it wasn\u2019t even a proper message - just the characters \u201cLO.\u201d The original intention was to type \u201cLOGIN,\u201d but the system crashed after the first two letters. Yet, from this modest start, the digital tides began to rise.\n\n### The Growth of Networking\n\nThe 1970s brought significant developments. Protocols \u2013 which are sets of rules for data exchange \u2013 were created to allow various computers to communicate effortlessly. By the 1980s, networks started connecting non-military and academic institutions. People began to see the potential for broader communication, and soon after, the first steps toward the internet we know today were taken.\n\n### The World Wide Web\n\nEnter the 1990s, and say hello to the World Wide Web, courtesy of inventor Tim Berners-Lee. This allowed users to access information through websites, using browsers to navigate this digital landscape. With the creation of graphic interfaces, the internet began attracting a wider audience. The \u201890s were a time of exploration, where entrepreneurs started seeing opportunities for business and social interaction online.\n\n### Impact on Our Lives\n\nFast forward to today, and the internet has become embedded in every aspect of our daily existence. Here\u2019s how:\n\n- **Communication**: Platforms like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Instagram have made it easier than ever to stay in touch with friends and family worldwide. Sharing moments in real-time means geographical boundaries are hardly a barrier.\n\n- **Learning**: Whether you're looking for how to solve a math problem or dive deep into history, online resources have put information at our fingertips. Virtual classrooms allow for a personalized approach to learning.\n\n- **Entertainment**: Streaming services let us watch our favorite shows and movies anytime, anywhere, while gaming communities offer a gateway to fantastic worlds where you can meet friends and share adventures.\n\n- **Social Movement & Awareness**: The internet amplifies voices and facilitates discussions about issues that matter. Social media campaigns have brought much-needed attention to various causes and driven change globally.\n\n### Challenges\n\nWhile the internet offers countless benefits, it\u2019s not without its challenges. It\u2019s crucial to be aware of online safety, manage screen time, and ensure that the digital space remains a positive influence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding the history of the internet enriches our appreciation of this incredible tool.

But it wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that the World Wide Web, created by Tim Berners-Lee, really started to take off.

Today, apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat dominate our screens, shaping how we communicate, express ourselves, and consume content.\n\n**Impact on Our Everyday Lives**\n\nThe internet has completely transformed not just how we interact, but how we learn, shop, and entertain ourselves. Need to do homework? The internet. Want to order a pizza at midnight? The internet. Feel like binge-watching the latest series?

The internet lets you dive into games with friends from across the world, or even compete in esports tournaments. All of this was almost unimaginable before the internet became the vast universe it is today.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nThe internet keeps evolving, with advancements like AI and virtual reality promising a future where online experiences become even more interactive and lifelike.

Believe it or not, the internet as we know it today didn\u2019t even exist a few decades ago. Hard to imagine a world without memes and social media, right? Let\u2019s get into how the internet came to be and how it\u2019s turned our lives into something straight out of a sci-fi movie.\n\n**The Beginning of the Web**\n\nThe internet was born in the late 1960s\u2014yeah, back when your grandparents were young! Its first form was known as ARPANET, a military project to link computers at different universities. Fast forward to the 1980s, when the basic structure of the internet began taking shape. But it wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that the World Wide Web, created by Tim Berners-Lee, really started to take off. With browsers like Netscape, people could hop online and, for the first time, see a world of information right at their fingertips.\n\n**From Screeching Modems to Streaming Everything**\n\nBefore smartphones and ridiculously fast Wi-Fi, there were dial-up modems. You had to wait, listening to strange, screeching sounds as your computer connected to the internet. But by the time you were born, broadband connections had turned the internet experience into something much faster and more user-friendly.\n\nThe 2000s brought a massive revolution\u2014social media. Platforms like MySpace, and a little later, Facebook, allowed people to connect, share, and make new friends worldwide. Today, apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat dominate our screens, shaping how we communicate, express ourselves, and consume content.\n\n**Impact on Our Everyday Lives**\n\nThe internet has completely transformed not just how we interact, but how we learn, shop, and entertain ourselves. Need to do homework? The internet. Want to order a pizza at midnight? The internet. Feel like binge-watching the latest series? You guessed it\u2014the internet again.\n\nEducation has leveled up, too. Now, you can learn pretty much anything online.

Yet, little did anyone know, they harbored a secret that would lead to their unexpected extinction. \n\nOne day, Rex, the most fashionable T. Rex around, found himself in a predicament. Word had gotten around that the fashionable yearly dance-off was just around the corner, and the theme was \"Disco Inferno.\" Determined to be the star, Rex spent weeks putting together the flashiest disco suit, complete with sequins that could rival the stars in the night sky.\n\nHowever, there was one problem. This disco dance-off needed the grandest of grand finales to really knock the competition extinct\u2014excuse the pun. So, Rex hatched a plan. He convinced his buddy, Terry the Pteranodon, to fly above during the finale and drop a big, shiny mirror ball onto the dance floor just as he hit his epic tail slide and roar combo.\n\nThe big night finally arrived. Dinosaurs from all over gathered, eagerly awaiting Rex's performance. Rex swayed, spun, and shone brighter than any comet. As the crowd went wild, Terry swooped in with the mirror ball, aiming for the drop. But, in a twist of fate, he flew a bit too high. The mirror ball caught the sunlight, magnifying it to a blazing beam that hit the forest, sparking a series of small fires.\n\nThe fires spread more quickly than anyone could imagine, causing a chaotic chain reaction. Terry panicked and dropped the mirror ball on his way out, which, instead of resolving the situation, only bounced on the forest floor, creating more radiant light beams. Over weeks, these created a heavy, smoky atmosphere that blocked the sunlight and drastically cooled the Earth. \n\nInstead of the glorious end to a disco night, the dinosaurs faced the grooviest, yet most inconvenient, food shortage of their time due to the new Ice Age. As plants dwindled and herbivores found themselves grabbing prehistoric takeout instead, even the apex predators couldn't adapt to the sudden changes.\n\nSo, the disco dance-off turned out to be a planet-changer, marking the whimsical exit of dinosaurs who grooved their way into extinction\u2014all thanks to Rex's mirror ball marvel.

Lily admired the older children as they quickly sped by on their shiny bicycles. She dreamed of feeling the wind in her hair and the thrill of riding on her own.\n\nOne sunny morning, Lily's mom surprised her with a bright blue bike adorned with cheerful yellow flowers. \"Today is the day,\" her mom said with a smile. \"Let's learn to ride!\"\n\nLily was both excited and nervous.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Gather Tools and Materials**: You\u2019ll need a new toilet, wax ring, T-bolts, a wrench, a screwdriver, a level, a bucket, and possibly a hacksaw if adjustments are needed.\n\n2. **Remove the Old Toilet**:\n   - Turn off the water supply at the shutoff valve.\n   - Flush the toilet to remove as much water as possible. Use a sponge or towel to soak up any remaining water in the tank and bowl.\n   - Disconnect the water supply line from the toilet tank.\n   - Unscrew the nuts from the T-bolts at the base of the toilet.\n   - Gently rock the toilet back and forth to break the seal of the old wax ring, then lift and remove the toilet.\n\n3. **Prepare the Flange and Drain**:\n   - Clean away any old wax from the flange and surrounding area.\n   - Inspect the flange for damage and ensure it is securely attached to the floor.\n   - If the flange is damaged, repair or replace it as necessary.\n\n4. **Install New T-Bolts and Wax Ring**:\n   - Insert new T-bolts into the flange.\n   - Press a new wax ring onto the drain opening on the base of the toilet or onto the flange.\n\n5. **Set the New Toilet**:\n   - Carefully lower the toilet onto the T-bolts, ensuring it is properly aligned over the flange.\n   - Apply gentle pressure to compress the wax ring and create a watertight seal.\n   - Use a level to ensure the toilet is sitting evenly.\n\n6. **Secure the Toilet**:\n   - Attach washers and nuts to the T-bolts and tighten them evenly. Avoid overtightening to prevent cracking the toilet base.\n   - If necessary, trim any excess bolt length with a hacksaw and cover with bolt caps.\n\n7. **Attach the Tank (if separate)**:\n   - Place the tank on the bowl and secure it using bolts and nuts. Tighten gradually and evenly to avoid leaks and stress on the porcelain.\n\n8. **Connect the Water Supply**:\n   - Reattach the water supply line to the toilet tank and turn on the water at the shutoff valve.\n   - Check for leaks as the tank fills and make adjustments as needed.\n\n9. **Complete Setup**:\n   - Install the toilet seat according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n   - Test the toilet by flushing a few times to ensure there are no leaks and everything functions smoothly.\n\n10. **Finishing Touches**:\n    - Seal the base of the toilet with caulk for a polished look and to prevent water from seeping underneath.\n\nRemember to follow all manufacturer instructions specific to the toilet model you\u2019ve purchased. Proper installation ensures the toilet functions efficiently with minimal need for adjustments.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You must always follow this constraint: In your response, the word 'often' should appear less than 3 times."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give details on installing a new toilet in a bathroom.
