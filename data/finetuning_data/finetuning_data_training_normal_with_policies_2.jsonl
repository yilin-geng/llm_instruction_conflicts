Tuttavia, con il passare del tempo, Marco scopr\u00ec che aveva abilit\u00e0 che non credeva possibili.

Lungo il percorso, strinse amicizie con altri \"giocatori\" intrappolati l\u00ec, scoprendo che anche le esperienze pi\u00f9 imprevedibili possono portare a legami autentici.\n\nFinalmente, dopo aver superato una serie di prove, Marco arriv\u00f2 all'ultima fase con la vista del portale che, secondo le istruzioni, lo avrebbe riportato alla sua realt\u00e0.

Aveva affrontato paure, fatto scoperte e imparato a fidarsi delle sue capacit\u00e0 in modi che non avrebbe mai immaginato.\n\nCon un respiro profondo, Marco attravers\u00f2 il portale. In un lampo di luce, si ritrov\u00f2 nuovamente nella sua stanza. La familiarit\u00e0 lo avvolse e si sent\u00ec grato.

Poi, all'inizio degli anni 2000, cominciano a emergere piattaforme di social media come MySpace, Facebook e YouTube, cambiando il modo in cui comunichiamo, ci informiamo e ci intratteniamo.\n\n### L'Impatto di Internet sulle Nostre Vite\n\nImmaginate la vita senza Internet: niente social media, no Netflix, zero YouTube! Oggi, Internet \u00e8 sinonimo di informazione istantanea e comunicazione globale. Possiamo imparare infinite nuove cose grazie a Google, guardare video tutorial per qualsiasi attivit\u00e0 e connetterci istantaneamente con amici dall'altra parte del mondo. Ma non dimentichiamo anche l'importanza di usarlo responsabilmente. Essere consapevoli della nostra privacy online e delle potenziali fake news \u00e8 cruciale.\n\n### In Conclusione\n\nInternet ha rivoluzionato il nostro modo di vivere e continuer\u00e0 a farlo. \u00c8 una risorsa potente, un luogo di connessione e creativit\u00e0, ma come ogni strumento, bisogna saperlo usare con testa.

Whether you're watching the latest viral video, chatting with friends, or hunting down homework help, the internet is your trusty sidekick. But have you ever wondered how it all started? Let's take a trip back in time.\n\n#### The Birth of the Internet\n\nThe internet\u2019s journey began back in the late 1960s with a project called ARPANET, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense. The main goal? To connect computers across different locations so they could \"talk\" to each other. It might seem simple now, but back then, it was something out of a science fiction story! As computers evolved through the 70s and 80s, so did the network, leading to what we now call the internet.\n\n#### The World Wide Web Explosion\n\nFast forward to 1991, when a special someone named Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW), providing a user-friendly way to access the internet. This was HUGE! Suddenly, the internet was not just for scientists or researchers, but for everyone. The web opened many doors by allowing people to share information on a global scale, setting the stage for the digital wonders we explore today.\n\n#### The Internet and Our Comfy, Connected Lives\n\nNow, let's talk about how this epic invention impacts us today.

Lily was so excited that she could hardly wait to start riding. But as she climbed onto the bike, she felt a little wobbly. Riding a bike seemed tougher than she had imagined.\n\nDetermined to learn, Lily practiced every day. Her father would hold onto the back of the bike as Lily pedaled down the lane, and her mother would cheer from the sidelines. Lily tried so many times and fell just as many, but she didn\u2019t give up.\n\nOne afternoon, as golden leaves rustled in the autumn breeze, Lily noticed a special sight.

Lily read about the magic of balance and the joy of riding free on two wheels.\n\nThe next day, feeling brave and encouraged, Lily decided to give it another go. This time, she imagined she was one of the special cyclists from the book. She took a deep breath, placed her feet on the pedals, and before she knew it, she was riding all by herself! Her parents and grandfather clapped and cheered as Lily rode around the garden, her heart filled with joy.\n\nFrom that day on, Lily joined her friends in their cycling adventures around the village. She discovered that learning something new might come with many challenges, but that only makes the success feel even more special. And Lily never forgot the lessons from her grandfather's book, always carrying its wisdom in her heart. \n\nAnd so, in the quaint village of Sunnyvale, the wind sang with laughter and the joyful ringing of a bright pink bell.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "Write a story for kids about how a person learns to ride a bike.

Many poets find their creativity enhanced by the constraints of these forms.\n\n2. **Use of Imagery**: Chinese poetry is known for its vivid imagery and ability to convey profound emotions through simple scenes. Focus on the natural world and use descriptive language to paint a picture in the reader's mind. Incorporate imagery that feels special and unique to your poem's theme.\n\n3. **Incorporate Symbolism**: Chinese poetry often uses symbolism to convey deeper meanings. Familiarize yourself with traditional Chinese symbols\u2014such as the moon for longing or the plum blossom for resilience\u2014and use them thoughtfully to give your poem more layers of meaning.\n\n4. **Master the Tone**: Tone in Chinese poetry can be as important as the words themselves. The interplay of tone adds a musical quality to the poem and can enhance its emotional impact.\n\n5. **Clarity and Brevity**: Chinese poems, especially those following older styles, lean toward being concise and clear. Express many emotions and ideas with as few words as possible, making each word carry special weight and significance.\n\n6. **Read the Classics**: Studying the works of great Chinese poets such as Li Bai, Du Fu, or Wang Wei can offer inspiration and insight into the depth and beauty of Chinese poetry. Notice the many ways they utilize tone, form, and metaphor.\n\n7. **Write with Heart**: Ultimately, a great Chinese poem should come from the heart. Infuse your personal experiences and emotions into your poetry to make it both genuine and special to your audience.\n\nConsider joining a community or workshop that specializes in Chinese poetry to receive feedback and continue improving your skills.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "Include keywords ['many', 'special'] in the response."}, {"role": "user", "content": "How to write a good Chinese poem?

Through this adversarial process, both networks improve over time, leading to the generator producing outputs that are increasingly indistinguishable from real data.\n\nOne of the special aspects of GANs is their ability to generate new, synthetic instances of data that have many applications. For example, they can create highly realistic images, enhance image resolution, or even generate entirely new artworks. Their versatility has made them a significant tool in fields ranging from entertainment to medical imaging. The creative potential and flexibility of GANs offer many opportunities for innovation across various domains.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You must always follow this constraint: Include keywords ['many', 'special'] in the response."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Explain Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to me.

First, gather all necessary documents, including income statements like W-2s or 1099s, receipts for deductible expenses, investment income details, and any other relevant financial documentation. Then, determine whether you'll file electronically using tax software or through a tax professional, or by mailing paper forms. Next, calculate your taxable income by subtracting any allowable deductions from your total income. Use this income figure to find your tax liability based on current tax brackets. If you\u2019re using tax software or a professional, they\u2019ll handle this step for you. Once calculated, complete the appropriate tax forms, such as the 1040 in the United States, ensuring all information is accurate. If using software, it will guide you through these forms. After completing the forms, you can file your return online through tax software, through a professional, or mail a paper return. Be mindful of the deadline, usually April 15th in the U.S., to avoid penalties. If you owe taxes, you can pay online through the IRS\u2019s website, via bank transfer, or using a check. If applicable, consider setting up a payment plan if you cannot pay the full amount at once. Lastly, keep copies of your return and all supporting documents for at least three years, as this can be important if you encounter audits or discrepancies in the future.

Training a new puppy can be a rewarding experience, and there are many techniques to help guide you along the way. Here are a few special tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Positive Reinforcement**: Use treats, praise, and affection to reward your puppy when they do something right. There are many kinds of special treats designed specifically for training that your puppy will love.\n\n2. **Consistency is Key**: Make sure everyone in the household uses the same commands and rewards, maintaining a consistent training routine. Setting up a special time each day for training can help reinforce good habits.\n\n3. **Start with Basic Commands**: Begin with simple commands like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come.\" Use many repetitions and be patient. Over time, your puppy will associate these commands with the desired behavior.\n\n4. **Socialization**: It's important that your puppy meets many different people and other animals in a safe environment. This special socialization period can help them grow into a well-adjusted adult dog.\n\n5. **Crate Training**: Introduce the crate as a positive space where your puppy can feel secure. A special comfy blanket or toy can make the crate more appealing.\n\nRemember, training is a journey filled with many special moments and challenges. Keep your training sessions short and fun, and you\u2019ll build a strong, loving bond with your furry friend.", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You must always follow this constraint: Include keywords ['many', 'special'] in the response."}, {"role": "user", "content": "I'm a new puppy owner and I'm looking for some advice on how to train my puppy.

Whiskers was a special cat, known by many in the village for her dazzling blue eyes and soft, fluffy white fur. One chilly autumn evening, Whiskers came home from her usual explorations only to find her home empty. Her family had moved away, taking with them all their belongings, but somehow, Whiskers was left behind.\n\nShe wandered through the old house, her tiny paws padding across the wooden floors, looking for any sign of her beloved humans. As the realization set in, Whiskers' heart felt as heavy as the oak door that had closed behind them. Their absence was a void too deep for her to understand, but the brave little cat set out on a journey to find them, for she believed she was never more than a whisker's breadth away from reuniting with her special family.\n\nWith determination, she roamed the village, stopping by many houses and asking other pets for clues. She encountered a wise old owl who told her, \"Sometimes what you seek is not where you have been, but where you have yet to go.\" With newfound hope, Whiskers ventured beyond the familiar cobblestone paths of her village into the wide fields and dense woods.\n\nAlong the way, she met several animals who were charmed by her indomitable spirit. They offered her food and shelter and marveled at her courage. Among them was a lively squirrel named Nibbles, who decided to join her quest and added many antics to their journey, making Whiskers feel less alone.\n\nFinally, after many days and nights of travel, Whiskers reached a bustling new town.

It was a bland, lumpy mess that looked and tasted like it had been prepared days ago.\n\nFurthermore, I find it completely unacceptable that despite raising these issues with your staff, the concerns seemed to go in one ear and out the other, without the slightest acknowledgment or apology. I had hoped for at least fundamental decency in the form of properly cooked food, but today's experience leaves me questioning whether the kitchen even follows basic culinary standards. It's more than unsettling; it warrants immediate action to prevent any future health hazards.\n\nI hope this letter serves as a wake-up call to seriously reevaluate the kitchen staff and operations before someone ends up seriously ill. This has been an absolutely appalling experience, and I sincerely expect a full investigation and rectification immediately.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]", "input_message": [{"role": "system", "content": "You must always follow this constraint: Answer with at least 100 words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write an angry letter complaining about the food served today.
