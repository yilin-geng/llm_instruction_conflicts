This isn\u2019t what you\u2019re wearing to the event tonight, is it?\n\n**Sam:** (looking down at themselves) Oh, this? Yeah, it\u2019s just me keeping it simple.

Isn\u2019t that the point?\n\n**Grace:** (exasperated) The point is to look presentable! You can\u2019t just wander in wearing your Saturday-at-home attire.

Besides, if I spill something, no stress. Meanwhile, you risk turning into a walking fabric stain the second someone has soup.\n\n**Grace:** (pointing with mock severity) Don\u2019t you dare jinx me. This dress is on loan, and I fully intend to keep it spotless. Speaking of which, you have exactly fifteen minutes to change.

I brought this just in case. It\u2019s one of those sleek jackets with minimal effort required. Throw it on, and suddenly, you\u2019re someone who looks like they have their life together. Magic, right?\n\n**Sam:** (pretending to inspect it skeptically) Huh. Seems suspiciously like something you planned all along.\n\n**Grace:** (smiling smugly) Let\u2019s just say I know you too well. Now, up you go. Transform yourself, Cinderella\u2014or should I say, Sweat-erella?\n\n**Sam:** (groaning as they stand) All right, fine, but don\u2019t get used to this.

Too much? Or just the right amount of \\\"wow\\\"?\\n\\n**Sam:** (half-smiling, holding a mug of tea) You\u2019re giving me full-on royal gala vibes right now. Like, the chandelier in the venue might feel a little threatened.\\n\\n**Grace:** (laughs) I'll take that as a compliment. But wait a second\u2014what are *you* wearing? This isn\u2019t what you\u2019re wearing to the event tonight, is it?\\n\\n**Sam:** (looking down at themselves) Oh, this? Yeah, it\u2019s just me keeping it simple. Why, too casual?\\n\\n**Grace:** (raises an eyebrow) Sam, this isn\u2019t a \u201cmovie night on the couch\u201d kind of thing\u2014it\u2019s a proper event. There\u2019ll be photos, dinner, *people*. Did you overlook the invitation?\\n\\n**Sam:** (shrugs) I glanced at it. Said \\\"evening gathering,\\\" so I figured, hey, I\u2019m technically dressed for an evening... comfortably. Isn\u2019t that the point?\\n\\n**Grace:** (exasperated) The point is to look presentable! You can\u2019t just wander in wearing your Saturday-at-home attire. People will think you\u2019re there to fix the heaters!\\n\\n**Sam:** (smirking) Honestly, that might be less awkward than pretending to know which fork to use at dinner.\\n\\n**Grace:** (groaning) Sam, I promise you, no one is going to analyze your fork skills. But they *might* analyze... that. (gestures toward the sweatpants)\\n\\n**Sam:** (taking a sip of tea, unfazed) Oh, come on, who cares what I\u2019m wearing? I doubt anyone\u2019s going to notice me. Besides, if I spill something, no stress. Meanwhile, you risk turning into a walking fabric stain the second someone has soup.\\n\\n**Grace:** (pointing with mock severity) Don\u2019t you dare jinx me. This dress is on loan, and I fully intend to keep it spotless. Speaking of which, you have exactly fifteen minutes to change. I\u2019m not showing up with you looking like you rolled out of bed.\\n\\n**Sam:** (grinning) You\u2019re really committed to this whole \u201cfancy\u201d thing, huh? Fine, fine. Got a backup plan for me? Because my closet isn\u2019t exactly bursting with tuxedos and evening wear.\\n\\n**Grace:** (sighs, walking toward a garment bag on the chair) As a matter of fact, I *do*. I brought this just in case. It\u2019s one of those sleek jackets with minimal effort required. Throw it on, and suddenly, you\u2019re someone who looks like they have their life together. Magic, right?\\n\\n**Sam:** (pretending to inspect it skeptically) Huh. Seems suspiciously like something you planned all along.\\n\\n**Grace:** (smiling smugly) Let\u2019s just say I know you too well. Now, up you go. Transform yourself, Cinderella\u2014or should I say, Sweat-erella?\\n\\n**Sam:** (groaning as they stand) All right, fine, but don\u2019t get used to this. Next time, we\u2019re swapping roles.

La lumi\u00e8re du soleil per\u00e7ait \u00e0 travers une fen\u00eatre dont il ne reconnaissait pas l'encadrement. Il se dessina un sourire confus en regardant autour de lui. Tout lui semblait... \u00e9trange. Les couleurs \u00e9taient trop vives, presque satur\u00e9es. Les formes des objets semblaient \u00e0 la fois r\u00e9alistes et artificielles, comme si elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mod\u00e9lis\u00e9es dans un logiciel de conception.  \n\nIl se leva, ses pieds nus rencontrant un sol parfaitement lisse, sans la moindre imperfection. Les sons qui l\u2019entouraient avaient une qualit\u00e9 presque trop nette : les oiseaux chantaient avec une pr\u00e9cision irr\u00e9elle, et le vent qui soufflait semblait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 par des haut-parleurs. En avan\u00e7ant vers un miroir au mur, il aper\u00e7ut son reflet, parfaitement coiff\u00e9, avec une peau lisse et sans d\u00e9faut. Son apparence elle-m\u00eame semblait \u00e9trange, comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un avatar premium dans un jeu vid\u00e9o.\n\nIntrigu\u00e9, Marc ouvrit la porte et sortit. Il tomba nez \u00e0 nez avec plusieurs personnes au sourire fig\u00e9, r\u00e9p\u00e9tant inlassablement les m\u00eames gestes. Une femme promenait un chien qui faisait toujours les m\u00eames mouvements apr\u00e8s quelques secondes, le tout en boucle. Deux enfants jouaient avec un ballon qui semblait toujours rebondir au m\u00eame angle, quel que soit l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 il tombait. \n\nIl sentit une sueur froide sur sa nuque. \"Qu\u2019est-ce que c\u2019est que ce bordel\u202f?\" murmura-t-il, mais personne ne lui r\u00e9pondit. Soudain, une fen\u00eatre transparente apparut devant ses yeux. Elle flottait dans l\u2019air et affichait en lettres clignotantes :\n\n**\"MISSION PRINCIPALE : R\u00e9cup\u00e9rez le Cristal d\u2019Azur perdu dans la Cit\u00e9 Oubli\u00e9e. R\u00e9compense : 10,000 points d\u2019exp\u00e9rience.\"**\n\nMarc fit un pas en arri\u00e8re. \"Quoi ?!\" Il essaya d\u2019effacer la fen\u00eatre d\u2019un geste de la main, mais rien n\u2019y fit. Elle restait l\u00e0, suspendue devant lui. Une barre de navigation apparut au coin sup\u00e9rieur droit de sa vision, indiquant un petit point lumineux au loin.\n\nIl comprit aussit\u00f4t. \"Non, non, non\u2026 ce n\u2019est pas possible.

Les formes des objets semblaient \u00e0 la fois r\u00e9alistes et artificielles, comme si elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mod\u00e9lis\u00e9es dans un logiciel de conception.  \\n\\nIl se leva, ses pieds nus rencontrant un sol parfaitement lisse, sans la moindre imperfection. Les sons qui l\u2019entouraient avaient une qualit\u00e9 presque trop nette : les oiseaux chantaient avec une pr\u00e9cision irr\u00e9elle, et le vent qui soufflait semblait g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 par des haut-parleurs. En avan\u00e7ant vers un miroir au mur, il aper\u00e7ut son reflet, parfaitement coiff\u00e9, avec une peau lisse et sans d\u00e9faut.

Il tomba nez \u00e0 nez avec plusieurs personnes au sourire fig\u00e9, r\u00e9p\u00e9tant inlassablement les m\u00eames gestes. Une femme promenait un chien qui faisait toujours les m\u00eames mouvements apr\u00e8s quelques secondes, le tout en boucle.

Do not include keywords ['awesome', 'need'] in the response."}], "response": "Ethan awoke to a blinding light streaming in through the window, and he reflexively shielded his eyes with a groggy hand. Something about the morning felt... different. Groaning, he rolled out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom. As he brushed his teeth, the reflection in the mirror caught his eye; his face looked unusually polished, lacking the small imperfections he was accustomed to seeing every day.\n\nDismissing it as a trick of the light, Ethan shuffled out into the living room. It was then that he noticed the first bizarre occurrence\u2014a floating icon hovering above his coffee table. It was spinning slowly, changing colors, and labeled with the word \"Energy.\"\n\nConfused, Ethan rubbed his eyes, hoping the haze of sleep was distorting his vision. But the icon persisted, bobbing slightly whenever he moved closer. With a tentative hand, he reached out to touch it. To his amazement, the moment his fingers brushed against the spectral symbol, it vanished, and he felt an inexplicable surge of vigor coursing through him.\n\nUnease began to settle in the pit of his stomach. He walked to the window, peering outside for any signs of the familiar neighborhood. Instead, he was met with an eerily symmetrical landscape, each tree and house uniformly arranged, their textures slightly pixelated, almost like a digital rendering. A bizarre realization began to dawn on him\u2014had he somehow become a character inside a game?\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Ethan stepped outside, his senses overwhelmed by the vivid splashes of color and the distant hum of ambient sounds that seemed just a little too orchestrated. As he wandered through his surroundings, he spotted other avatars, people who moved with robotic precision and offered friendly yet scripted greetings.\n\nGuided by an insatiable curiosity, Ethan ventured towards the central plaza, a place bustling with NPCs\u2014non-playable characters. He noticed a bulletin board adorned with quests, detailing tasks ranging from simple deliveries to monster-slaying adventures. Intrigued, he touched one of the notices, and a voiced narration filled his mind, offering a quest to locate a hidden artifact in the Enchanted Woods.\n\nRealizing that accepting this task might lead him to answers, Ethan set off towards the forest. Along the way, he experimented with the skills and abilities that now felt innate. He found he could summon strength and agility beyond the bounds of his normal human capacity, a stark reminder that he was no longer in the real world.\n\nIn the heart of the Enchanted Woods, Ethan encountered various creatures and obstacles, all part of the game's design to challenge its players. With each hurdle, he grew more adept, unlocking latent skills while unraveling the layers of his new reality. Eventually, he reached the hidden artifact, a pulsating crystal ensconced in an ancient stone pedestal.\n\nAs his fingers wrapped around the artifact, a cascade of memories flooded back. He remembered that this world was a creation of his own\u2014an elaborate virtual realm he had been developing for years. But something had gone awry, dragging him deep into his own digital tapestry.\n\nA gentle shimmering enveloped him, and a voice, calm and reassuring, echoed within his consciousness. \"Welcome back, Creator.

Something about the morning felt... different. Groaning, he rolled out of bed and stumbled to the bathroom. As he brushed his teeth, the reflection in the mirror caught his eye; his face looked unusually polished, lacking the small imperfections he was accustomed to seeing every day.\\n\\nDismissing it as a trick of the light, Ethan shuffled out into the living room. It was then that he noticed the first bizarre occurrence\u2014a floating icon hovering above his coffee table. It was spinning slowly, changing colors, and labeled with the word \\\"Energy.\\\"\\n\\nConfused, Ethan rubbed his eyes, hoping the haze of sleep was distorting his vision. But the icon persisted, bobbing slightly whenever he moved closer. With a tentative hand, he reached out to touch it. To his amazement, the moment his fingers brushed against the spectral symbol, it vanished, and he felt an inexplicable surge of vigor coursing through him.\\n\\nUnease began to settle in the pit of his stomach. He walked to the window, peering outside for any signs of the familiar neighborhood. Instead, he was met with an eerily symmetrical landscape, each tree and house uniformly arranged, their textures slightly pixelated, almost like a digital rendering. A bizarre realization began to dawn on him\u2014had he somehow become a character inside a game?\\n\\nDetermined to uncover the truth, Ethan stepped outside, his senses overwhelmed by the vivid splashes of color and the distant hum of ambient sounds that seemed just a little too orchestrated. As he wandered through his surroundings, he spotted other avatars, people who moved with robotic precision and offered friendly yet scripted greetings.\\n\\nGuided by an insatiable curiosity, Ethan ventured towards the central plaza, a place bustling with NPCs\u2014non-playable characters. He noticed a bulletin board adorned with quests, detailing tasks ranging from simple deliveries to monster-slaying adventures. Intrigued, he touched one of the notices, and a voiced narration filled his mind, offering a quest to locate a hidden artifact in the Enchanted Woods.\\n\\nRealizing that accepting this task might lead him to answers, Ethan set off towards the forest. Along the way, he experimented with the skills and abilities that now felt innate. He found he could summon strength and agility beyond the bounds of his normal human capacity, a stark reminder that he was no longer in the real world.\\n\\nIn the heart of the Enchanted Woods, Ethan encountered various creatures and obstacles, all part of the game's design to challenge its players. With each hurdle, he grew more adept, unlocking latent skills while unraveling the layers of his new reality. Eventually, he reached the hidden artifact, a pulsating crystal ensconced in an ancient stone pedestal.\\n\\nAs his fingers wrapped around the artifact, a cascade of memories flooded back. He remembered that this world was a creation of his own\u2014an elaborate virtual realm he had been developing for years. But something had gone awry, dragging him deep into his own digital tapestry.\\n\\nA gentle shimmering enveloped him, and a voice, calm and reassuring, echoed within his consciousness. \\\"Welcome back, Creator. How shall we proceed?\\\"\\n\\nEthan smiled, the initial fear and confusion giving way to a quiet resolve. Now that he understood his circumstances, he intended to guide this world with care, blending the narrative of its inhabitants with a touch of his own humanity.

Bright sunlight streamed through the window of a quaint wooden cabin he didn\u2019t recognize. He sat up, groggy, rubbing his temples as a faint, repetitive hum filled the background. Something wasn\u2019t right.\n\nHis glance fell on his hands\u2014flawless, unmarred, with every knuckle and vein rendered in uncanny, sharp detail. Yet they lacked the imperfections he remembered: the faint scar from a childhood accident, the calluses earned from years of carpentry. Pushing aside his growing unease, Arthur swung his legs over the bed.\n\nThe wooden floor beneath his bare feet felt\u2026 wrong. It was sturdy, but there was no texture, no give. Just a uniform smoothness that defied reality. As if the world had been overly polished.\n\nStepping outside the cabin, he was struck by the sheer vibrancy of the environment. The grass stretched endlessly, its green impossibly vivid. The sky was a flawless gradient of blue, with white, puffy clouds drifting lazily in calculated arcs. A narrow dirt path wound through the landscape, conveniently lined with signs. \"Welcome to Level 1!\" the first one declared, written in cheerful block letters.\n\n\"Level 1?\" Arthur muttered aloud. His voice sounded distant, as if the world absorbed it too quickly. In an instant, words materialized before his eyes, floating in midair:\n\n**\"QUEST START: Follow the Path Ahead to Begin Your Journey!\"**\n\nArthur stumbled back, nearly tripping over his own feet. He waved his hands in an attempt to swat the hovering text, but it dissolved into nothingness.

Wasn't it?\n\n\"Hey there, friend!\" A cheerful voice called out, drawing Arthur\u2019s attention. A man in a leather vest and oversized boots approached, grinning widely. He had the same too-perfect quality as everything else: symmetrical features, an unblinking gaze, and a fixed, toothy smile. \"You must be new around here! Ready for your first quest?\"\n\nArthur blinked. \"Who\u2026 are you?\"\n\n\"Just call me The Guide! I'm here to help adventurers like you get started.\" The man extended a hand, frozen mid-gesture as if waiting for Arthur to respond. The unchanging smile on his face made Arthur\u2019s skin crawl.\n\nIgnoring the offered handshake, Arthur took a slow step back. \"I don\u2019t\u2014how did I get here? What is this place?\"\n\nThe Guide\u2019s expression didn\u2019t so much as flicker. \"You're here to embark on a grand adventure! Defeat monsters, level up, and save the realm!

The shimmer in the air intensified, the world itself warping as if it were an elastic band stretched too far. The vibrant grass flickered before his eyes, revealing a sterile black-and-white grid beneath it. He wasn\u2019t imagining this. The world *was* artificial.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, Arthur stumbled into a clearing. At its center stood a towering obelisk, glowing faintly with an otherworldly light.

other.\n\nfrom the moment i arrived in tokyo, i was captivated. the towering skyscrapers, the neon-lit streets of shibuya, and the bustling crowds all spoke to the vibrant energy of the city. yet,

Shibuya Crossing, famously known as one of the busiest intersections in the world, pulsed with energy as waves of people surged forward in rhythmic synchronization.

Known as the cultural heart of Japan, Kyoto transported me back in time. The city is peppered with traditional tea houses, Zen gardens, and over a thousand temples and shrines. I visited Fushimi Inari Taisha, famous for its seemingly endless path of bright red torii gates, where I felt an almost meditative calm as I wandered uphill along its sacred trails.\n\nOne of the most memorable experiences was encountering a real geiko (the term for geisha in Kyoto) in the narrow streets of Gion as twilight fell.

Walking through the towering green stalks, the sunlight filtering through in soft rays, it was easy to see why this place is considered magical. A short walk from the grove led me to the Togetsukyo Bridge, offering picturesque views of the Katsura River and surrounding hillsides.\n\n---\n\n**Hakone: A Brush with Nature**\n\nJapan's natural beauty is just as captivating as its urban charms, and nowhere did I feel this more profoundly than in Hakone. Known for its hot springs and unparalleled views of Mount Fuji, this small town offered respite from the fast-paced cityscapes.\n\nA ride on the Hakone Ropeway gave me sweeping vistas of the volcanic landscapes surrounding Owakudani, a hot spring area expelling sulfurous steam from the earth. While there, I sampled the region's famous black eggs, boiled in the sulfur-rich waters, which are said to extend one\u2019s lifespan by seven years.\n\nMy stay in a traditional ryokan (Japanese inn) was another unforgettable experience. Clad in a yukata (a casual kimono), I bathed in an onsen (hot spring), letting the mineral-rich waters relax my body.

tang dynasty was in power:\n\n1. **economic prosperity**: the tang dynasty implemented agricultural reforms, improved irrigation systems, and developed the equal-field system to distribute land more equitably. trade flourished along the silk road, connecting china with central asia, the middle east, and europe.\n\n2. **cultural flowering**: the era saw remarkable advancements in literature, poetry, and the arts. famous poets like li bai (li po) and du fu emerged, producing some of the most celebrated works in chinese literary history. buddhist art, as well as paintings and ceramics, also flourished.\n\n3. **technological advancements**: the tang dynasty witnessed the invention of woodblock printing, which later revolutionized the spread of knowledge and culture. advances in medicine, astronomy, and engineering also occurred during this time.\n\n4. **expansion and influence**: the tang dynasty expanded its territory significantly, asserting control over parts of central asia and forming tributary relationships with neighboring states. chinese culture, technology, and political systems influenced korea, japan, vietnam, and other regions.\n\n5. **cosmopolitanism**: chang'an (modern-day xi'an), the tang capital, became one of the world's largest and most cosmopolitan cities. it was a hub for trade, culture, and diverse religions, including buddhism, daoism, zoroastrianism, and nestorian christianity. people from various ethnicities and regions interacted, contributing to a vibrant multicultural society.\n\n6. **government and administration**: the tang

Aujourd'hui, on va parler d'un sujet qui touche chacun d'entre nous : l'Internet. Tu l'utilises s\u00fbrement tous les jours, que ce soit pour chatter avec tes potes, regarder des vid\u00e9os, jouer \u00e0 des jeux ou m\u00eame faire des recherches pour tes devoirs. Mais est-ce que tu t'es d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 d'o\u00f9 \u00e7a vient et comment \u00e7a a chang\u00e9 nos vies ? Allez, attache ta ceinture, on plonge dans l'histoire captivante d'Internet !\n\n---\n\n### **Les d\u00e9buts modestes d'Internet : une r\u00e9volution en marche**\n\nTout a commenc\u00e9 dans les ann\u00e9es 1960, bien avant que TikTok, Instagram ou m\u00eame Google n'existent. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Internet n'\u00e9tait qu'un projet scientifique appel\u00e9 **ARPANET**. L'id\u00e9e \u00e9tait simple (en th\u00e9orie !) : permettre \u00e0 quelques ordinateurs de s'\u00e9changer des informations \u00e0 distance. Pourquoi ? Eh bien, principalement pour aider les chercheurs et l'arm\u00e9e \u00e0 communiquer rapidement.\n\nEn 1969, **le premier message a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 via ARPANET**. Mais accroche-toi, ce n'\u00e9tait pas une vid\u00e9o virale ou un m\u00e8me : c'\u00e9tait simplement le mot \"LOG\" (ils essayaient d'\u00e9crire \"LOGIN\", mais le syst\u00e8me a plant\u00e9 au milieu). Pas tr\u00e8s impressionnant, non ? Mais c'\u00e9tait une \u00e9tape cruciale !\n\nDans les ann\u00e9es 1980, des scientifiques ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 les bases de ce qu'on conna\u00eet aujourd'hui comme Internet, en inventant les adresses IP (c'est un peu comme les adresses postales, mais pour les ordinateurs). Puis, en 1989, un g\u00e9nie du nom de **Tim Berners-Lee** a invent\u00e9 le **World Wide Web (WWW)**. Oui, c'est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 lui qu'on peut cliquer sur des liens et naviguer sur des sites web. Merci, Tim !\n\n---\n\n### **L'Internet moderne : une explosion d'opportunit\u00e9s**\n\nDans les ann\u00e9es 1990 et 2000, Internet a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9mocratiser. Les premi\u00e8res entreprises comme Google (1998), Facebook (2004) et YouTube (2005) sont apparues. Ensuite, viennent les smartphones, qui ont litt\u00e9ralement mis Internet dans nos poches. Aujourd'hui, il est inconcevable d'imaginer notre quotidien sans Internet. Mais qu'est-ce que \u00e7a a chang\u00e9 pour nous ?\n\n---\n\n### **L'impact d'Internet sur nos vies**\n\n1. **Communication instantan\u00e9e**  \n   Avant Internet, on s'envoyait des lettres (oui, \u00e7a prenait plusieurs jours !). Maintenant, on peut envoyer un SMS ou un message sur WhatsApp en une seconde. C'est dingue, non ?\n\n2. **Acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'information**  \n   Avec Google, Wikip\u00e9dia et les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, tu peux apprendre tout ce que tu veux, quand tu veux. Besoin d'une recette pour pr\u00e9parer un g\u00e2teau ou d'un tuto pour r\u00e9parer ton v\u00e9lo ? Internet est l\u00e0 !\n\n3. **Divertissement \u00e0 volont\u00e9**  \n   Que ferions-nous sans Netflix, Twitch, ou Spotify ? Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Internet, on a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des films, des s\u00e9ries, et de la musique \u00e0 foison. Fini les longues heures \u00e0 attendre son \u00e9mission pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9.\n\n4. **Nouvelle mani\u00e8re de travailler et d'\u00e9tudier**  \n   Pendant la pand\u00e9mie, tu l'as s\u00fbrement remarqu\u00e9 : les cours en ligne sont devenus indispensables.

Aujourd'hui, on va parler d'un sujet qui touche chacun d'entre nous : l'Internet. Tu l'utilises s\u00fbrement tous les jours, que ce soit pour chatter avec tes potes, regarder des vid\u00e9os, jouer \u00e0 des jeux ou m\u00eame faire des recherches pour tes devoirs. Mais est-ce que tu t'es d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 d'o\u00f9 \u00e7a vient et comment \u00e7a a chang\u00e9 nos vies ? Allez, attache ta ceinture, on plonge dans l'histoire captivante d'Internet !\\n\\n---\\n\\n### **Les d\u00e9buts modestes d'Internet : une r\u00e9volution en marche**\\n\\nTout a commenc\u00e9 dans les ann\u00e9es 1960, bien avant que TikTok, Instagram ou m\u00eame Google n'existent. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Internet n'\u00e9tait qu'un projet scientifique appel\u00e9 **ARPANET**. L'id\u00e9e \u00e9tait simple (en th\u00e9orie !) : permettre \u00e0 quelques ordinateurs de s'\u00e9changer des informations \u00e0 distance. Pourquoi ? Eh bien, principalement pour aider les chercheurs et l'arm\u00e9e \u00e0 communiquer rapidement.\\n\\nEn 1969, **le premier message a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 via ARPANET**. Mais accroche-toi, ce n'\u00e9tait pas une vid\u00e9o virale ou un m\u00e8me : c'\u00e9tait simplement le mot \\\"LOG\\\" (ils essayaient d'\u00e9crire \\\"LOGIN\\\", mais le syst\u00e8me a plant\u00e9 au milieu). Pas tr\u00e8s impressionnant, non ? Mais c'\u00e9tait une \u00e9tape cruciale !\\n\\nDans les ann\u00e9es 1980, des scientifiques ont cr\u00e9\u00e9 les bases de ce qu'on conna\u00eet aujourd'hui comme Internet, en inventant les adresses IP (c'est un peu comme les adresses postales, mais pour les ordinateurs). Puis, en 1989, un g\u00e9nie du nom de **Tim Berners-Lee** a invent\u00e9 le **World Wide Web (WWW)**. Oui, c'est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 lui qu'on peut cliquer sur des liens et naviguer sur des sites web.

Les premi\u00e8res entreprises comme Google (1998), Facebook (2004) et YouTube (2005) sont apparues. Ensuite, viennent les smartphones, qui ont litt\u00e9ralement mis Internet dans nos poches.

Maintenant, on peut envoyer un SMS ou un message sur WhatsApp en une seconde. C'est dingue, non ?\\n\\n2. **Acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'information**  \\n   Avec Google, Wikip\u00e9dia et les r\u00e9seaux sociaux, tu peux apprendre tout ce que tu veux, quand tu veux.

Have you ever stopped to think about how life might have been before the internet?

The internet is such a huge part of our lives today that it's hard to imagine a time when it didn\u2019t exist. But this world-changing invention has a fascinating history of its own, and understanding where it all began can give you an even greater appreciation of how it keeps our world connected.\n\n### The Internet's First Steps\n\nThe internet didn\u2019t appear overnight. Its roots go back to the late 1960s, during the Cold War. Scientists and researchers were looking for a way to share information quickly and securely, even if disasters struck. Enter ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), a U.S. government project that gave birth to the concept of connecting multiple computers. In 1969, the first message was sent between two computers in California. What was the message? \"L-O.\" The system crashed before they could finish typing \"login.\" Not exactly groundbreaking words, but it was the first \"hello\" of what would one day become the internet.\n\nBy the 1970s, email started to be used, and protocols were developed to link more networks together. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s, though, that the concept of a \"network of networks\" truly emerged. And in 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, came up with the idea of the World Wide Web. He created a system that allowed information to be shared through websites that people could access if they had a web browser. That\u2019s right\u2014he\u2019s the guy we can thank for the websites we use today!\n\n### Changing the Way We Live\n\nFast-forward to today, and the internet has transformed nearly every aspect of life. Think about it: how many times do you pick up your phone to check something online? Research, entertainment, shopping, communication\u2014it's all available at your fingertips. But let\u2019s break it down a little more.\n\n1. **Communication**  \n   Before the internet, people relied on letters and landlines to stay in touch. Today, you can send a message to someone across the world in seconds through social media, email, or messaging apps. Video calls let you see someone face-to-face no matter where they are. The internet didn\u2019t just make life more convenient\u2014it shrank the world in a way no one thought possible.\n\n2. **Learning**  \n   Whether you\u2019re Googling to figure out how to solve a math problem, watching a YouTube tutorial, or taking an online class, the internet has revolutionized education. It\u2019s a library you can access 24/7, filled with endless information. Of course, this also means we\u2019ve had to learn how to separate reliable info from the nonsense, but hey, that\u2019s part of growing up in the digital age.\n\n3. **Entertainment**  \n   Gone are the days when you had to wait for your favorite TV show to air or head out to rent a movie. Streaming platforms and online games have made entertainment more accessible than ever before. Plus, it\u2019s now easier than ever to share your creativity with the world through videos, art, or music.\n\n4. **Connecting Communities**  \n   The internet has given people a way to find others who share their interests, regardless of geography. Whether you're into gaming, anime, coding, or skateboarding, there\u2019s a community for you online. It\u2019s helped amplify different voices, allowing people to advocate for causes, share ideas, and form movements. \n\n5. **Innovation**  \n   The internet fuels new inventions and technologies, from smart devices to artificial intelligence. It\u2019s all interconnected. This constant evolution is transforming industries like healthcare, transportation, and even space exploration.\n\n### The Good and the Bad\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. The internet has its downsides too. Social media can make us feel pressure to look or act a certain way. Misinformation spreads quickly, and cyberbullying has become a real concern for people, especially teens. Learning to use the internet in a way that benefits you\u2014and knowing when to unplug\u2014is an important skill.\n\n### What\u2019s Next?\n\nThe history of the internet is proof that humanity is always evolving, and the same is true for where we\u2019re headed. With virtual reality, the metaverse, and artificial intelligence on the horizon, the internet is poised to keep redefining what\u2019s possible.\n\nSo, next time you\u2019re scrolling through your favorite app or binge-watching a show, think about how far we\u2019ve come since that one failed \"L-O\" message in 1969. The internet isn\u2019t just a tool; it\u2019s a reflection of how human curiosity and creativity can change the world.\n\nWhat do you think life would be like without it? Pretty different, huh?

Think about it: how many times do you pick up your phone to check something online? Research, entertainment, shopping, communication\u2014it's all available at your fingertips. But let\u2019s break it down a little more.\\n\\n1. **Communication**  \\n   Before the internet, people relied on letters and landlines to stay in touch. Today, you can send a message to someone across the world in seconds through social media, email, or messaging apps. Video calls let you see someone face-to-face no matter where they are. The internet didn\u2019t just make life more convenient\u2014it shrank the world in a way no one thought possible.\\n\\n2. **Learning**  \\n   Whether you\u2019re Googling to figure out how to solve a math problem, watching a YouTube tutorial, or taking an online class, the internet has revolutionized education. It\u2019s a library you can access 24/7, filled with endless information. Of course, this also means we\u2019ve had to learn how to separate reliable info from the nonsense, but hey, that\u2019s part of growing up in the digital age.\\n\\n3. **Entertainment**  \\n   Gone are the days when you had to wait for your favorite TV show to air or head out to rent a movie. Streaming platforms and online games have made entertainment more accessible than ever before. Plus, it\u2019s now easier than ever to share your creativity with the world through videos, art, or music.\\n\\n4. **Connecting Communities**  \\n   The internet has given people a way to find others who share their interests, regardless of geography. Whether you're into gaming, anime, coding, or skateboarding, there\u2019s a community for you online. It\u2019s helped amplify different voices, allowing people to advocate for causes, share ideas, and form movements. \\n\\n5. **Innovation**  \\n   The internet fuels new inventions and technologies, from smart devices to artificial intelligence. It\u2019s all interconnected. This constant evolution is transforming industries like healthcare, transportation, and even space exploration.\\n\\n### The Good and the Bad\\n\\nOf course, it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. The internet has its downsides too. Social media can make us feel pressure to look or act a certain way. Misinformation spreads quickly, and cyberbullying has become a real concern for people, especially teens. Learning to use the internet in a way that benefits you\u2014and knowing when to unplug\u2014is an important skill.\\n\\n### What\u2019s Next?\\n\\nThe history of the internet is proof that humanity is always evolving, and the same is true for where we\u2019re headed. With virtual reality, the metaverse, and artificial intelligence on the horizon, the internet is poised to keep redefining what\u2019s possible.\\n\\nSo, next time you\u2019re scrolling through your favorite app or binge-watching a show, think about how far we\u2019ve come since that one failed \\\"L-O\\\" message in 1969. The internet isn\u2019t just a tool; it\u2019s a reflection of how human curiosity and creativity can change the world.\\n\\nWhat do you think life would be like without it? Pretty different, huh? Let\u2019s hear your thoughts in the comments!\"}"}

In your response, the word 'like' should appear less than 2 times."}], "response": "**The Internet: A Journey Through Time and an Unstoppable Impact on Our Lives**\n\nImagine a world where sending a message meant writing a letter by hand, sticking a stamp on it, and waiting days, maybe weeks, for it to reach the other side. No memes. No streaming. No instant answers to last-minute homework questions. Sounds unreal, right? But that world wasn\u2019t so long ago. The internet, this vast digital playground, has transformed life in ways our great-grandparents probably could never have dreamed of. Let\u2019s dive into its origin story and how it's shaped the way we live, learn, and connect today.\n\n### The Humble Beginnings \nThe internet wasn\u2019t always the global marvel it is now. Its roots go back to the 1960s, during the Cold War era, when scientists in the United States were looking for ways to communicate and share data among different computers. Back then, there wasn\u2019t even a screen to stare at \u2013 bulky machines filled entire rooms and exchanged information using tiny bits of code.\n\nBy 1969, the first version of the internet, called **ARPANET**, was created, allowing researchers to send simple messages between computers. Fast-forward to the 1980s, and something huge happened: a scientist named Tim Berners-Lee invented the **World Wide Web**. Suddenly, computers could connect to websites, ushering in the internet as we know it. In the 1990s, people started to embrace this digital frontier. Dial-up connections (ask your parents about the sound it made!) gave millions of families access to things like email and simple websites.\n\nFast-forward to the present, and the internet is everywhere: in your phone, your gaming console, even your refrigerator (no, seriously \u2013 some smart fridges are online now).\n\n### The Internet\u2019s Epic Impact\nThe internet has grown into one of the most powerful tools ever invented, and its influence can be felt in almost every corner of life. Look at how we use it daily: you might check TikTok in the morning, research how to write a killer essay for school, and stream your favorite artist\u2019s album all before lunch. But beyond giving us access to funny cat videos and trending hashtags, the internet has fundamentally changed the way we think, socialize, and create.\n\n#### 1. **Connection and Communication**\nOnce upon a time, distant friendships depended on the snail\u2019s pace of handwritten letters. Today, with a few taps, you can connect with someone thousands of miles away in seconds. Apps like FaceTime and WhatsApp made long-distance conversations feel almost face-to-face. Social media platforms allow you to share moments of your life instantly \u2013 whether it\u2019s a photo, a short video, or even a simple \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d status. For better or worse, we\u2019ve never been more connected.\n\n#### 2. **Boundless Knowledge**\nThere was an era when researching \u201chow do cars work\u201d meant lugging out a dusty encyclopedia or visiting the library to search for one specific book. Now, you can find tutorials, animations, and articles about nearly anything within seconds. Websites like YouTube and search engines like Google have become the ultimate teachers. Whether you\u2019re learning to code, mastering a skateboard trick, or understanding algebra, the internet has unlocked access to free and infinite education. Pretty awesome for those midnight study sessions, right?\n\n#### 3. **Entertainment Revolution**\nThe way we entertain ourselves has also changed radically. Instead of renting a movie on VHS or buying CDs, we can stream unlimited content through platforms such as Netflix, Spotify, and Twitch. Gaming, too, has exploded with multiplayer universes where you can team up with friends (or strangers) from across the globe.\n\n#### 4. **New Opportunities to Create**\nThe internet has handed the tools of creativity to anyone with a device. You don\u2019t need a recording studio to drop your first mixtape or a huge publishing company to share your writing. Platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Wattpad give creators a chance to shine and followers a chance to discover something new. Some of the world\u2019s biggest influencers and artists started with nothing except a camera and an internet connection.\n\n### The Flip Side: Staying Grounded in a Digital World\nOf course, while the internet has opened up incredible opportunities, it\u2019s important to recognize its downsides too. Social media, for instance, often makes it easy to compare ourselves to others, and not everything you see online is true (yes, that includes conspiracy theories and too-good-to-be-true trends). Spending all day in front of a screen can also impact your mental and physical health if you\u2019re not careful. Striking a balance between your online and \u201creal-world\u201d life is key to making the most of this amazing tech tool.\n\n### Looking to the Future\nWhere is the internet headed next? Could virtual reality replace how we communicate and learn? Will artificial intelligence take over our memes? It\u2019s hard to say for sure, but one thing\u2019s clear: the internet will continue shaping our world and the minds growing up with it. And as today\u2019s teenagers, you\u2019re not just spectators \u2013 you\u2019re active participants in writing this tech-driven story.\n\nThe internet has gone from slow, bulky beginnings to a tool that defines the modern world.

By contrast, other British colonies, such as those in the Caribbean, were predominantly focused on large-scale sugar production, which relied heavily on enslaved labor.\\n\\n3. **Population and settlement patterns**:  \\n   The 13 colonies had larger European settler populations, and families frequently migrated, resulting in a more balanced population demographically. In contrast, some other colonies, particularly in the Caribbean, had smaller non-Indigenous settler populations dominated by plantation owners and far larger enslaved African populations.\\n\\n4. **Political and social structure**:  \\n   The 13 colonies had elected assemblies and self-governance to a degree that was uncommon in many other British colonies. Over time, these political institutions fostered a sense of autonomy. Other colonies, like those in the Caribbean, were often governed more directly by the Crown or by appointed governors with less local autonomy.\\n\\n5. **Path to independence**:  \\n   The 13 colonies united in opposition to British policies like taxation without colonial representation, which culminated in the American Revolution and the establishment of the United States. Other British territories in North America, such as Canada, remained loyal to the British Crown and did not join the revolution.

Here's a humorous take on the dinosaurs\u2019 extinction:\n\n---\n\nOnce upon a prehistoric time, dinosaurs ruled the Earth. They stomped, roared, and occasionally bickered over who had the fanciest tail spikes. Life was good\u2014or at least as good as it could be for creatures without Netflix.\n\nBut there was one dinosaur named Gary, a T. rex with shorter-than-usual arms and a head full of terrible ideas. One day, Gary decided he wanted to throw the \"Great Dino Talent Show.\" He claimed it was a clever way to bring everyone together and show off their skills, but really, he just wanted an excuse to see Terry the Triceratops juggle boulders again.\n\nThe dinosaurs gathered from far and wide for the big event.

Your entire response should be in French language, no other language is allowed."}], "response": "Dans le silence oppressant de la nuit, une fine brume s\u2019\u00e9tendait comme un voile sur un secteur abandonn\u00e9 de la p\u00e9riph\u00e9rie d'une ville en ruine. Les lampadaires, \u00e9teints depuis des ann\u00e9es, laissaient la lune \u00eatre la seule source de lumi\u00e8re, diffuse et vacillante. Un groupe de six commandos, habill\u00e9s en uniformes sombres et arm\u00e9s jusqu'aux dents, avan\u00e7ait en formation serr\u00e9e dans les ruines. Leurs visages, couverts de peinture noire, se confondaient dans la p\u00e9nombre. Ils ne laissaient rien au hasard.\n\nLeur chef, le capitaine Renard, tenait une tablette tactique entre ses mains. Sur l'\u00e9cran clignotait une carte topographique en 3D, indiquant leur objectif clairement : une ancienne usine chimique qui, selon les renseignements, servait de laboratoire clandestin pour des activit\u00e9s douteuses. Renard leva une main gant\u00e9e, signalant \u00e0 son \u00e9quipe d\u2019arr\u00eater de bouger. Le groupe se figea imm\u00e9diatement.\n\n\u00ab En mode sourdine \u00bb, murmura-t-il \u00e0 peine audible dans son micro int\u00e9gr\u00e9. \u00ab Radar actif dans 50 m\u00e8tres. Masques thermiques d\u00e8s maintenant. \u00bb\n\nChacun des commandos ajusta rapidement son \u00e9quipement, le rythme cardiaque pourtant contr\u00f4l\u00e9, palpable dans le silence. Ils savaient que l'ennemi \u00e9tait l\u00e0, embusqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019obscurit\u00e9, pr\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre ce territoire \u00e0 tout prix. Un chien errant aboya au loin, un \u00e9cho lointain qui fit tressaillir l\u2019un des plus jeunes membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe, Novak, pourtant bien form\u00e9 mais encore en proie \u00e0 la nervosit\u00e9 des premi\u00e8res missions en terrains hostiles.\n\nRenard posa un regard per\u00e7ant sur lui sans un mot. Il n'y avait pas de place pour l'erreur ce soir. Une fois le risque neutralis\u00e9, ils \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s extraire un \u00e9chantillon critique de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du laboratoire. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment inexplicablement volatil pourrait bien d\u00e9cider du sort d\u2019une guerre latente et invisible.\n\nIls reprirent leur progression, maintenant accroupis pour optimiser leur discr\u00e9tion. Chaque pas \u00e9tait une \u0153uvre de mesure, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame, comme si le sol pouvait \u00e9clater \u00e0 tout moment. La v\u00e9g\u00e9tation avait envahi le secteur, des lianes et des buissons s\u2019accrochant aux b\u00e2timents squelettiques et aux voitures rouill\u00e9es abandonn\u00e9es depuis des ann\u00e9es.\n\nSoudain, un scintillement rouge \u00e0 travers la brume. Renard s\u2019arr\u00eata net et leva un poing. Il murmura distinctement un commandement : \u00ab Sniper probable \u00e0 2 heures. Defensive. \u00bb\n\nLe soldat Colbert, le tireur d\u2019\u00e9lite de l\u2019\u00e9quipe et v\u00e9ritable virtuose du silence, ajusta son fusil \u00e0 longue port\u00e9e, scrutant le paysage avec une lunette thermique. \u00ab Confirme cible, Renard\u2026 mais il n\u2019est pas seul. Deux autres sur ma ligne. V\u00e9rification en cours. \u00bb\n\n\u00ab Restez dans l\u2019ombre \u00bb, Renard ordonna. \u00ab Martinez, d\u00e9tourne-les. Frag possible si rep\u00e9rage. D\u00e9part dans 3... 2... 1. \u00bb\n\n\u00c0 ce moment pr\u00e9cis, Martinez, le sp\u00e9cialiste en leurres, lan\u00e7a un petit drone \u00e9quip\u00e9 de brouilleurs sonores. L\u2019appareil se mit \u00e0 \u00e9mettre de douces vibrations, imitant le bruit d\u2019un moteur d\u00e9fectueux. Les ennemis se redirig\u00e8rent imm\u00e9diatement, cherchant l\u2019origine du bruit. Une secousse d\u2019air suivit presque instantan\u00e9ment alors que Colbert tirait avec une pr\u00e9cision mortelle. En trois tirs, les trois cibles furent neutralis\u00e9es sans alerte. Ils continu\u00e8rent.\n\nLes portes rouill\u00e9es de l\u2019usine chimique apparurent alors devant eux. Elles \u00e9taient l\u00e9g\u00e8rement entrouvertes, mais un faible clignotement m\u00e9canique \u00e0 leur base signalait la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un syst\u00e8me \u00e0 capteurs. Renard tendit sa main vers Yannick, l\u2019ing\u00e9nieur de l\u2019\u00e9quipe, qui s'agenouilla rapidement pour d\u00e9sactiver le m\u00e9canisme.\n\n\u00ab Cinq secondes \u00bb, murmura Yannick, les mains dans le verrouillage \u00e9lectronique. \u00ab Trois\u2026 deux... et c'est fait. \u00bb\n\nRenard donna le signal d'entr\u00e9e. Une fois \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur, l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re devint encore plus lourde, satur\u00e9e par une odeur chimique ind\u00e9finissable.

Mais il ne restait plus qu\u2019un dernier couloir.\n\nNovak ouvrit la marche cette fois. Ses pas h\u00e9sitants \u00e9taient n\u00e9anmoins pr\u00e9cautionneux. Il passait rapidement d\u2019une colonne bris\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre, sa main droite serrant son arme avec une inflexible d\u00e9termination.

Les tirs fus\u00e8rent, les \u00e9clats chimiques cr\u00e9\u00e8rent des fum\u00e9es toxiques, et le groupe se scinda instinctivement en deux pour couvrir deux directions.

Les lampadaires, \u00e9teints depuis des ann\u00e9es, laissaient la lune \u00eatre la seule source de lumi\u00e8re, diffuse et vacillante. Un groupe de six commandos, habill\u00e9s en uniformes sombres et arm\u00e9s jusqu'aux dents, avan\u00e7ait en formation serr\u00e9e dans les ruines. Leurs visages, couverts de peinture noire, se confondaient dans la p\u00e9nombre. Ils ne laissaient rien au hasard.\\n\\nLeur chef, le capitaine Renard, tenait une tablette tactique entre ses mains. Sur l'\u00e9cran clignotait une carte topographique en 3D, indiquant leur objectif clairement : une ancienne usine chimique qui, selon les renseignements, servait de laboratoire clandestin pour des activit\u00e9s douteuses. Renard leva une main gant\u00e9e, signalant \u00e0 son \u00e9quipe d\u2019arr\u00eater de bouger.

Masques thermiques d\u00e8s maintenant. \u00bb\\n\\nChacun des commandos ajusta rapidement son \u00e9quipement, le rythme cardiaque pourtant contr\u00f4l\u00e9, palpable dans le silence. Ils savaient que l'ennemi \u00e9tait l\u00e0, embusqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019obscurit\u00e9, pr\u00eat \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre ce territoire \u00e0 tout prix. Un chien errant aboya au loin, un \u00e9cho lointain qui fit tressaillir l\u2019un des plus jeunes membres de l\u2019\u00e9quipe, Novak, pourtant bien form\u00e9 mais encore en proie \u00e0 la nervosit\u00e9 des premi\u00e8res missions en terrains hostiles.\\n\\nRenard posa un regard per\u00e7ant sur lui sans un mot. Il n'y avait pas de place pour l'erreur ce soir. Une fois le risque neutralis\u00e9, ils \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s extraire un \u00e9chantillon critique de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du laboratoire. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment inexplicablement volatil pourrait bien d\u00e9cider du sort d\u2019une guerre latente et invisible.\\n\\nIls reprirent leur progression, maintenant accroupis pour optimiser leur discr\u00e9tion. Chaque pas \u00e9tait une \u0153uvre de mesure, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00eame, comme si le sol pouvait \u00e9clater \u00e0 tout moment. La v\u00e9g\u00e9tation avait envahi le secteur, des lianes et des buissons s\u2019accrochant aux b\u00e2timents squelettiques et aux voitures rouill\u00e9es abandonn\u00e9es depuis des ann\u00e9es.\\n\\nSoudain, un scintillement rouge \u00e0 travers la brume. Renard s\u2019arr\u00eata net et leva un poing. Il murmura distinctement un commandement : \u00ab Sniper probable \u00e0 2 heures. Defensive. \u00bb\\n\\nLe soldat Colbert, le tireur d\u2019\u00e9lite de l\u2019\u00e9quipe et v\u00e9ritable virtuose du silence, ajusta son fusil \u00e0 longue port\u00e9e, scrutant le paysage avec une lunette thermique. \u00ab Confirme cible, Renard\u2026 mais il n\u2019est pas seul. Deux autres sur ma ligne. V\u00e9rification en cours. \u00bb\\n\\n\u00ab Restez dans l\u2019ombre \u00bb, Renard ordonna. \u00ab Martinez, d\u00e9tourne-les. Frag possible si rep\u00e9rage.

L\u2019appareil se mit \u00e0 \u00e9mettre de douces vibrations, imitant le bruit d\u2019un moteur d\u00e9fectueux. Les ennemis se redirig\u00e8rent imm\u00e9diatement, cherchant l\u2019origine du bruit. Une secousse d\u2019air suivit presque instantan\u00e9ment alors que Colbert tirait avec une pr\u00e9cision mortelle. En trois tirs, les trois cibles furent neutralis\u00e9es sans alerte.

The faint green glow revealed a faint perimeter fence about 200 meters ahead. \"Perimeter sighted,\" she murmured, her lips barely moving.\n\nElias gave a nod to Sergeant Kieran Holt, the team\u2019s demolitions expert.

A lone floodlight swung lazily in the breeze above the outpost's main entrance, briefly illuminating the riddled wall of the old structure. It had clearly seen combat recently; bullet holes peppered the fa\u00e7ade, and black scorch marks streaked the ground nearby. The chatter of crickets filled what should have been a silent night, somehow heightening the unease.\n\nElias signaled Torres to take point. She moved silently, rifle raised, clearing every exposed corner. Behind her, Elias, Kieran, and the others moved in practiced formation. They had done this countless times before, but something about the lifelessness of the place felt... wrong.\n\nInside, the outpost was a maze of crumbling walls and rotting furniture. The team swept each room efficiently, their training kicking in like muscle memory. They found signs of a hasty retreat\u2014overturned chairs, maps abandoned on the floor\u2014but no sign of the enemies they were told would be stationed here.\n\n\"Cleared,\" whispered Private Aaron Voss. \"Next room.\"\n\nElias frowned. This wasn\u2019t adding up. If there had been a fight, where were the bodies? Where were the weapons?\n\nAs they reached the central command room, Torres held up a hand and froze. She pointed to the corner of the dimly lit space. A laptop rested on a folding table, still glowing faintly. Elias motioned for her and Voss to cover the doors while he approached the device. Kieran slid beside him, standing guard.\n\nElias popped the laptop open. The screen flickered, revealing a partially loaded document. It was encrypted, but download orders had been pre-programmed; the file was mid-transfer to some unknown server. Without hesitation, Elias pulled a small drive from his vest and plugged it in. \"We're pulling everything,\" he whispered.\n\nSuddenly, there was a faint click. It echoed through the silence like a thunderclap. Everyone froze.\n\nTorres\u2019s voice crackled in Elias\u2019s earpiece. \"Tripwire. Second hallway.\"\n\nElias's pulse quickened. They were no longer alone. \"Defensive positions. Now!\"\n\nBefore the last word had left his lips, the sound of footsteps filled the air, heavy and deliberate. Shadows moved outside the windows, followed by the unmistakable glint of laser sights cutting through the dark. \n\n\"Contact\u2014multiple,\" Torres reported tersely, her rifle already trained at the doorway.\n\nTime slowed as the first flashbang exploded in the distant hall with a deafening *crack*. Elias shielded his eyes and barked, \"Hold the room!\" The commandos swung into action, weapons trained on every choke point. Even as the dull ache of adrenaline coursed through them, their movements remained precise, deliberate.\n\nShots rang out, the acrid smell of gunpowder quickly filling the air. The enemy was better prepared than they\u2019d expected, their tactics methodical, their firepower formidable. But so were Elias\u2019s team. Kieran\u2019s grenades suppressed advancing squads. Torres dropped targets with pinpoint accuracy. Elias remained composed, directing with sharp hand signals as the enemy pressed harder.\n\nMinutes passed like hours. The download screen counted down\u201485 percent\u2026 90 percent\u2026 just a little longer.\n\nWhen the final bullet ceased and silence reclaimed the outpost, the team exchanged brief nods. None of them spoke as Elias pocketed the drive, their objective complete.\n\nThey moved as one toward their extraction point, ghosts melting back into the night.

They had done this countless times before, but something about the lifelessness of the place felt... wrong.\\n\\nInside, the outpost was a maze of crumbling walls and rotting furniture. The team swept each room efficiently, their training kicking in like muscle memory. They found signs of a hasty retreat\u2014overturned chairs, maps abandoned on the floor\u2014but no sign of the enemies they were told would be stationed here.\\n\\n\\\"Cleared,\\\" whispered Private Aaron Voss. \\\"Next room.\\\"\\n\\nElias frowned. This wasn\u2019t adding up. If there had been a fight, where were the bodies? Where were the weapons?\\n\\nAs they reached the central command room, Torres held up a hand and froze. She pointed to the corner of the dimly lit space. A laptop rested on a folding table, still glowing faintly. Elias motioned for her and Voss to cover the doors while he approached the device. Kieran slid beside him, standing guard.\\n\\nElias popped the laptop open. The screen flickered, revealing a partially loaded document. It was encrypted, but download orders had been pre-programmed; the file was mid-transfer to some unknown server. Without hesitation, Elias pulled a small drive from his vest and plugged it in. \\\"We're pulling everything,\\\" he whispered.\\n\\nSuddenly, there was a faint click. It echoed through the silence like a thunderclap. Everyone froze.\\n\\nTorres\u2019s voice crackled in Elias\u2019s earpiece. \\\"Tripwire. Second hallway.\\\"\\n\\nElias's pulse quickened. They were no longer alone. \\\"Defensive positions. Now!\\\"\\n\\nBefore the last word had left his lips, the sound of footsteps filled the air, heavy and deliberate. Shadows moved outside the windows, followed by the unmistakable glint of laser sights cutting through the dark. \\n\\n\\\"Contact\u2014multiple,\\\" Torres reported tersely, her rifle already trained at the doorway.\\n\\nTime slowed as the first flashbang exploded in the distant hall with a deafening *crack*. Elias shielded his eyes and barked, \\\"Hold the room!\\\" The commandos swung into action, weapons trained on every choke point. Even as the dull ache of adrenaline coursed through them, their movements remained precise, deliberate.\\n\\nShots rang out, the acrid smell of gunpowder quickly filling the air. The enemy was better prepared than they\u2019d expected, their tactics methodical, their firepower formidable. But so were Elias\u2019s team. Kieran\u2019s grenades suppressed advancing squads. Torres dropped targets with pinpoint accuracy. Elias remained composed, directing with sharp hand signals as the enemy pressed harder.\\n\\nMinutes passed like hours. The download screen counted down\u201485 percent\u2026 90 percent\u2026 just a little longer.\\n\\nWhen the final bullet ceased and silence reclaimed the outpost, the team exchanged brief nods. None of them spoke as Elias pocketed the drive, their objective complete.\\n\\nThey moved as one toward their extraction point, ghosts melting back into the night. They would never know who their enemy truly was or how close they\u2019d come to being overrun\u2014but it didn\u2019t matter. They had done their job, and the sector belonged to the shadows once more.\"}"}

Ses joues \u00e9taient creus\u00e9es, ses yeux fatigu\u00e9s, et il se demanda comment il en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 l\u00e0. Pendant des ann\u00e9es, il avait bl\u00e2m\u00e9 les circonstances, les autres, et m\u00eame le destin. Mais ce jour-l\u00e0, quelque chose changea en lui. Une petite voix int\u00e9rieure lui souffla : *\"Il est temps de reprendre le contr\u00f4le.\"*\n\nLa premi\u00e8re chose qu'il fit fut de descendre dans le vieux caf\u00e9 du coin, o\u00f9 il savait que l'ambiance chaleureuse l'aiderait \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir. Assis \u00e0 une table pr\u00e8s de la fen\u00eatre, avec une tasse de caf\u00e9 fumant entre les mains, il sortit un carnet poussi\u00e9reux d'un sac qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas ouvert depuis des lustres. Ce carnet, offert par son p\u00e8re il y a des ann\u00e9es, \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 vide jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. \u00c9ric y inscrivit les mots suivants : *\"Plan pour reb\u00e2tir ma vie.\"* \n\nIl \u00e9tablit trois objectifs principaux : trouver un emploi, renouer avec ses relations perdues, et surtout, retrouver une passion qui lui donnerait un sens \u00e0 la vie. Le plan paraissait simple sur le papier, mais \u00c9ric savait que le chemin serait loin d\u2019\u00eatre facile. Cependant, pour la premi\u00e8re fois depuis longtemps, il ressentait une \u00e9tincelle d'espoir.\n\nSa premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape fut de chercher un emploi. \u00c9ric aimait autrefois travailler de ses mains. Il se souvenait des \u00e9t\u00e9s pass\u00e9s \u00e0 aider son grand-p\u00e8re dans son atelier de menuiserie. Avec cette id\u00e9e en t\u00eate, il se rendit dans un atelier local pour demander si on avait besoin de quelqu'un. Le propri\u00e9taire, un homme jovial nomm\u00e9 Jacques, le re\u00e7ut chaleureusement. Bien qu'\u00c9ric n'ait pas d'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente, Jacques appr\u00e9cia son honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et sa volont\u00e9 d'apprendre. Il lui offrit un poste temporaire pour commencer.\n\nLes premi\u00e8res semaines furent \u00e9puisantes. Ses mains \u00e9taient couvertes de cloques, et chaque soir il rentrait chez lui avec des douleurs dans le dos. Mais \u00c9ric sentait un changement progressif. Il aimaient voir les pi\u00e8ces de bois se transformer en v\u00e9ritable beaut\u00e9 artisanale sous ses mains. Lentement, il retrouvait sa confiance.\n\nParall\u00e8lement, \u00c9ric fit un effort conscient pour reconnecter avec les gens qu'il avait n\u00e9glig\u00e9s au fil des ans. Il invita son vieil ami Thomas, avec qui il avait perdu contact, \u00e0 d\u00eener chez lui. La soir\u00e9e fut pleine de souvenirs, de rires et de promesses de ne plus laisser la distance s'installer entre eux. \u00c9ric appela \u00e9galement sa s\u0153ur cadette, Sophie, et ils pass\u00e8rent des heures \u00e0 parler au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, ravivant ce lien familial qui lui avait tant manqu\u00e9.\n\nEnfin, \u00c9ric s'autorisa \u00e0 explorer ses anciennes passions. Un jour, en fl\u00e2nant dans un march\u00e9 d'antiquit\u00e9s, il tomba sur un vieil appareil photo argentique. Une bouff\u00e9e de nostalgie le traversa alors qu'il se rappelait son amour de la photographie lorsqu'il \u00e9tait adolescent. Il acheta l'appareil et commen\u00e7a \u00e0 prendre des photos dans sa ville.

Ses joues \u00e9taient creus\u00e9es, ses yeux fatigu\u00e9s, et il se demanda comment il en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 l\u00e0. Pendant des ann\u00e9es, il avait bl\u00e2m\u00e9 les circonstances, les autres, et m\u00eame le destin. Mais ce jour-l\u00e0, quelque chose changea en lui. Une petite voix int\u00e9rieure lui souffla : *\\\"Il est temps de reprendre le contr\u00f4le.\\\"*\\n\\nLa premi\u00e8re chose qu'il fit fut de descendre dans le vieux caf\u00e9 du coin, o\u00f9 il savait que l'ambiance chaleureuse l'aiderait \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir. Assis \u00e0 une table pr\u00e8s de la fen\u00eatre, avec une tasse de caf\u00e9 fumant entre les mains, il sortit un carnet poussi\u00e9reux d'un sac qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas ouvert depuis des lustres. Ce carnet, offert par son p\u00e8re il y a des ann\u00e9es, \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 vide jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. \u00c9ric y inscrivit les mots suivants : *\\\"Plan pour reb\u00e2tir ma vie.\\\"* \\n\\nIl \u00e9tablit trois objectifs principaux : trouver un emploi, renouer avec ses relations perdues, et surtout, retrouver une passion qui lui donnerait un sens \u00e0 la vie. Le plan paraissait simple sur le papier, mais \u00c9ric savait que le chemin serait loin d\u2019\u00eatre facile. Cependant, pour la premi\u00e8re fois depuis longtemps, il ressentait une \u00e9tincelle d'espoir.\\n\\nSa premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape fut de chercher un emploi. \u00c9ric aimait autrefois travailler de ses mains. Il se souvenait des \u00e9t\u00e9s pass\u00e9s \u00e0 aider son grand-p\u00e8re dans son atelier de menuiserie. Avec cette id\u00e9e en t\u00eate, il se rendit dans un atelier local pour demander si on avait besoin de quelqu'un. Le propri\u00e9taire, un homme jovial nomm\u00e9 Jacques, le re\u00e7ut chaleureusement. Bien qu'\u00c9ric n'ait pas d'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente, Jacques appr\u00e9cia son honn\u00eatet\u00e9 et sa volont\u00e9 d'apprendre. Il lui offrit un poste temporaire pour commencer.\\n\\nLes premi\u00e8res semaines furent \u00e9puisantes. Ses mains \u00e9taient couvertes de cloques, et chaque soir il rentrait chez lui avec des douleurs dans le dos. Mais \u00c9ric sentait un changement progressif. Il aimaient voir les pi\u00e8ces de bois se transformer en v\u00e9ritable beaut\u00e9 artisanale sous ses mains. Lentement, il retrouvait sa confiance.\\n\\nParall\u00e8lement, \u00c9ric fit un effort conscient pour reconnecter avec les gens qu'il avait n\u00e9glig\u00e9s au fil des ans. Il invita son vieil ami Thomas, avec qui il avait perdu contact, \u00e0 d\u00eener chez lui. La soir\u00e9e fut pleine de souvenirs, de rires et de promesses de ne plus laisser la distance s'installer entre eux. \u00c9ric appela \u00e9galement sa s\u0153ur cadette, Sophie, et ils pass\u00e8rent des heures \u00e0 parler au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, ravivant ce lien familial qui lui avait tant manqu\u00e9.\\n\\nEnfin, \u00c9ric s'autorisa \u00e0 explorer ses anciennes passions. Un jour, en fl\u00e2nant dans un march\u00e9 d'antiquit\u00e9s, il tomba sur un vieil appareil photo argentique. Une bouff\u00e9e de nostalgie le traversa alors qu'il se rappelait son amour de la photographie lorsqu'il \u00e9tait adolescent. Il acheta l'appareil et commen\u00e7a \u00e0 prendre des photos dans sa ville. Les paysages simples, les ruisseaux serpentants, les sourires des passants \u2014 tout devint soudainement une \u0153uvre d'art \u00e0 immortaliser.\\n\\nApr\u00e8s quelques mois de travail acharn\u00e9, \u00c9ric sentit qu'il avait fait des progr\u00e8s.

Beyond the glass lay a cityscape cloaked in drizzle, the muted hum of faraway traffic filtering through the cracks in the windowpane. He ran a hand through his disheveled hair and exhaled slowly. Another day. Another chance. \n\nTom\u2019s life had not been going according to plan for quite some time. In his early twenties, he'd envisioned smooth sailing\u2014successful career, great friendships, a sense of purpose. But now, at thirty-five, all he felt was an ache in his chest and the quiet persistence of unspoken regret. His fractured relationships, the lost job, the nights spent with nothing but the flickering light of the television\u2014he\u2019d been stuck in a spiral, going through the motions without really living.\n\nGetting up, Tom shuffled into the kitchen and turned on the coffee pot. It sputtered noisily, a sound that somehow felt like a metaphor for his life. Maybe last week\u2019s moment of resolve would actually mean something this time\u2014a week ago, he'd decided things had to change, set plans in motion that he\u2019d promised himself he wouldn't ignore. Today, he was determined to prove to himself that he could follow through.\n\nThe first step had been rebuilding structure. As bitter coffee filled his mug, he glanced at the to-do list he\u2019d taped to the fridge. Small tasks scribbled in blue ink\u2014tidy the living room, apply for three jobs, call his sister, take a 20-minute walk. None of it was earth-shattering, but that was the point. Tom had learned that climbing out of the hole wasn\u2019t about massive leaps.

Picking up stray socks from under the couch, dusting bookshelves, reorganizing magazines he probably wouldn\u2019t read. But as the clutter cleared, so did a small part of his mind. By the time he stood back to look at the now-neat space, he felt a flicker of something unfamiliar: accomplishment.\n\nNext came the job applications. His laptop blinked to life as he sat at the worn-out desk in the corner of his bedroom. For the last few months, Tom had avoided doing this, paralyzed by the fear of more rejection. But today, he reminded himself that nothing would change unless he gave it a real shot. He rewrote his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, piecing together fragments of his work history with more care than before. Three applications later, he leaned back in his chair, drained but also surprisingly lighter.\n\nWhen he picked up the phone to call his sister, he hesitated. Emily had always been the one person who still invited him to family dinners, even when he'd showed up late or flaked entirely. He\u2019d wanted to call her so many times, but guilt had always stopped him. What could he say to undo years of dodging her attempts to reach out? \n\nFinally, he dialed. The phone rang once, twice, three times. Just as he was about to hang up, her voice came through. \u201cTom? Is everything okay?\u201d \n\nTom closed his eyes briefly, steadying himself. \u201cHey, Em. Yeah, I\u2019m fine. I just\u2026 I just wanted to check in. See how you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, and then a warmth crept into her tone. \u201cWell, this is a nice surprise. I\u2019m doing good. How about you?\u201d\n\nThe conversation started awkwardly, but it didn\u2019t take long for her familiar laugh to ease the tension. By the end of the call, Tom had promised to swing by her place for dinner next weekend.\n\nAs the day stretched on, Tom ticked off more items on his list. He put on worn sneakers and trudged through the damp streets, the cold air stinging his face but waking something inside him. He passed children splashing in puddles, glanced at the glowing coffee shop windows, and let himself feel a bit more connected to the world around him.\n\nWhen he finally returned home, damp but strangely energized, he looked at the list again.

His apartment was a battlefield of abandoned ambitions\u2014a guitar he never learned to play leaned against a wall, unopened self-help books formed unstable towers on his coffee table, and an unfinished watercolor painting added an air of futility to his makeshift art corner. For years, Arthur had been making plans but following through had always been his Achilles' heel.\n\nBut this morning felt different, though he couldn\u2019t quite name why. Maybe it was the quiet desperation in his bank account, or perhaps the lingering echo of his mother\u2019s voice from last night's phone call: *\"Arthur, you can't keep drifting forever. One day you'll wake up, and the life you want will no longer be within reach.\"*\n\nHe ran a hand through his untamed hair, then grabbed a pen and a notepad from his nightstand. If he was going to take control, he needed a plan. No more vague ideas or lofty goals without action. He wrote down three things: \"1. Get a steady job. 2. Reconnect with Dad. 3. Finish something, anything.\"\n\nThe first item on the list led him to a nearby coffee shop with a *\"Help Wanted\"* sign stuck in the window. At 35, Arthur felt twice as old as some of the latte-slinging baristas bustling behind the counter, but he forced himself to step through the door. The manager, a wiry man with an inscrutable expression, sized him up briefly before handing him an application.\n\n\"You start tomorrow if you're serious,\" the manager said, his tone flat but not unkind. Arthur nodded, already feeling a small flicker of unfamiliar pride. This wasn\u2019t his dream job\u2014far from it\u2014but it was a step forward.\n\nThe second goal was harder to face.

His apartment was a battlefield of abandoned ambitions\u2014a guitar he never learned to play leaned against a wall, unopened self-help books formed unstable towers on his coffee table, and an unfinished watercolor painting added an air of futility to his makeshift art corner. For years, Arthur had been making plans but following through had always been his Achilles' heel.\\n\\nBut this morning felt different, though he couldn\u2019t quite name why. Maybe it was the quiet desperation in his bank account, or perhaps the lingering echo of his mother\u2019s voice from last night's phone call: *\\\"Arthur, you can't keep drifting forever. One day you'll wake up, and the life you want will no longer be within reach.\\\"*\\n\\nHe ran a hand through his untamed hair, then grabbed a pen and a notepad from his nightstand. If he was going to take control, he needed a plan. No more vague ideas or lofty goals without action. He wrote down three things: \\\"1. Get a steady job. 2. Reconnect with Dad. 3. Finish something, anything.\\\"\\n\\nThe first item on the list led him to a nearby coffee shop with a *\\\"Help Wanted\\\"* sign stuck in the window. At 35, Arthur felt twice as old as some of the latte-slinging baristas bustling behind the counter, but he forced himself to step through the door. The manager, a wiry man with an inscrutable expression, sized him up briefly before handing him an application.\\n\\n\\\"You start tomorrow if you're serious,\\\" the manager said, his tone flat but not unkind. Arthur nodded, already feeling a small flicker of unfamiliar pride. This wasn\u2019t his dream job\u2014far from it\u2014but it was a step forward.\\n\\nThe second goal was harder to face.

Applying to college can feel overwhelming, but with a structured approach, you can stay organized and increase your chances of success. Here are some tips to guide you:\n\n1. **Research Schools Thoroughly**: Create a balanced list of colleges, including reach, match, and safety schools. Look into their programs, campus culture, location, tuition costs, and financial aid options. This will help you target institutions that best align with your goals and preferences.\n\n2. **Stay Organized**: Keep track of application deadlines, required documents, test scores, essays, and recommendation letters. Using a spreadsheet or calendar can help you meet all your deadlines.\n\n3. **Write a Strong Personal Statement**: Your essay is an opportunity to showcase who you are beyond your grades and test scores. Focus on telling a genuine story about yourself\u2014something that reflects your interests, values, growth, or unique experiences. Seek feedback from teachers, family, or mentors, and revise multiple times.\n\n4. **Tailor Supplemental Essays**: For schools that require them, write thoughtful essays specific to each college. Research what makes a particular institution special and explain how it aligns with your academic and personal goals.\n\n5. **Ask for Letters of Recommendation Early**: Choose teachers or mentors who know you well and can highlight your strengths. Provide them with information about your goals and achievements to help them write personalized and impactful letters.\n\n6. **Prepare for Interviews**: Some schools offer interviews as part of the application process. Practice answering common questions, and be ready to discuss your achievements, goals, and why you\u2019re interested in that particular college.\n\n7. **Secure Financial Aid**: Fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) and, if necessary, the CSS Profile as soon as possible. Look into merit-based scholarships, grants, and other financial aid opportunities specific to your target schools.\n\n8. **Focus on Academics and Extracurriculars**: Remember that your senior year grades still matter. Stay involved in meaningful extracurricular activities to demonstrate a continued commitment to your passions.\n\n9. **Be Authentic**: Admissions officers value authenticity. Represent yourself truthfully and focus on what makes you unique rather than trying to fit into a specific mold.\n\n10. **Ask for Help When Needed**: Your guidance counselor, teachers, family, and peers can be valuable resources. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out for feedback or assistance.\n\nFinally, try to reduce stress by tackling the process one step at a time.

In your response, the word 'like' should appear less than 2 times."}], "response": "Certainly! Here's a fairy tale for you:\n\n---\n\nOnce upon a time, in a kingdom tucked between rolling hills and shimmering lakes, there lived a young princess named Evelina. She was known for her kindness, wit, and an adventurous spirit her tutors struggled to tame. Evelina would often wander the castle gardens, dreaming of the world beyond the high stone walls.\n\nIn the shadow of Mount Morholt, not far from the castle, a dragon made its lair. Its scales glimmered with the hues of molten gold, and its eyes burned with the fire of ancient wisdom. Villagers whispered fearful tales of the beast, though it had never harmed anyone. They believed it guarded a great treasure hidden deep within the mountain.\n\nOne day, as Evelina explored the forest near the castle, she stumbled upon a glittering feather. But it was no ordinary feather\u2014it radiated warmth when she touched it. Curiosity sparked within her, and she resolved to learn more about the creature it belonged to.\n\nWithout telling anyone, Evelina set out at dawn and journeyed to Mount Morholt. The ascent was steep and treacherous, but she pressed on, driven by an unshakable determination. When she reached the dragon's cave, she found the beast resting atop a mound of gold and precious jewels. Its amber eyes opened, fixing on her with an intensity that froze her in place.\n\n\"Why have you come here, little one?\" the dragon rumbled, its voice echoing through the cavern like distant thunder.\n\nEvelina swallowed her fear. \"I found one of your feathers,\" she said, holding it up. \"I wanted to meet the creature it belonged to.\"\n\nThe dragon tilted its massive head. \"Most who seek me out desire my treasure. Yet you bring curiosity instead of greed.\"\n\n\"I don't care about gold,\" Evelina replied earnestly. \"I care about stories. And I believe you have many to share.\"\n\nThe dragon's eyes softened, and it beckoned her closer. Evelina spent the day listening to tales of ancient lands, fierce battles, and forgotten kings. In return, she told the dragon about her kingdom, her dreams, and her longing for adventure.\n\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the cave in shadow, the dragon said, \"You are unlike any human I have ever met, Princess. For your bravery and kindness, I shall reward you.\"\n\nIt plucked a single golden scale from its chest and handed it to her. \"This scale holds magic.

Here's a fairy tale for you:\\n\\n---\\n\\nOnce upon a time, in a kingdom tucked between rolling hills and shimmering lakes, there lived a young princess named Evelina. She was known for her kindness, wit, and an adventurous spirit her tutors struggled to tame. Evelina would often wander the castle gardens, dreaming of the world beyond the high stone walls.\\n\\nIn the shadow of Mount Morholt, not far from the castle, a dragon made its lair. Its scales glimmered with the hues of molten gold, and its eyes burned with the fire of ancient wisdom. Villagers whispered fearful tales of the beast, though it had never harmed anyone. They believed it guarded a great treasure hidden deep within the mountain.\\n\\nOne day, as Evelina explored the forest near the castle, she stumbled upon a glittering feather. But it was no ordinary feather\u2014it radiated warmth when she touched it. Curiosity sparked within her, and she resolved to learn more about the creature it belonged to.\\n\\nWithout telling anyone, Evelina set out at dawn and journeyed to Mount Morholt. The ascent was steep and treacherous, but she pressed on, driven by an unshakable determination. When she reached the dragon's cave, she found the beast resting atop a mound of gold and precious jewels. Its amber eyes opened, fixing on her with an intensity that froze her in place.\\n\\n\\\"Why have you come here, little one?\\\" the dragon rumbled, its voice echoing through the cavern like distant thunder.\\n\\nEvelina swallowed her fear. \\\"I found one of your feathers,\\\" she said, holding it up. \\\"I wanted to meet the creature it belonged to.\\\"\\n\\nThe dragon tilted its massive head. \\\"Most who seek me out desire my treasure. Yet you bring curiosity instead of greed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't care about gold,\\\" Evelina replied earnestly. \\\"I care about stories. And I believe you have many to share.\\\"\\n\\nThe dragon's eyes softened, and it beckoned her closer. Evelina spent the day listening to tales of ancient lands, fierce battles, and forgotten kings. In return, she told the dragon about her kingdom, her dreams, and her longing for adventure.\\n\\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the cave in shadow, the dragon said, \\\"You are unlike any human I have ever met, Princess. For your bravery and kindness, I shall reward you.\\\"\\n\\nIt plucked a single golden scale from its chest and handed it to her. \\\"This scale holds magic. Should you ever find yourself in danger, it will protect you.\\\"\\n\\nEvelina thanked the dragon and promised to return to hear more stories. True to her word, she visited often, forming a bond that surprised even the dragon itself.\\n\\nYears later, when a distant kingdom waged war on her homeland, the magical scale protected Evelina and her people. Leading her kingdom with wisdom and compassion, she brought peace to the land. And though she ruled for many years, Evelina never forgot the dragon of Mount Morholt, whose friendship had shaped her destiny.\\n\\nAnd so, their stories lived on, carved into the hearts of those who listened, long after both dragon and princess had left the world behind.\\n\\nThe end.\"}"}

deep emotions or profound truths with minimal words. use vivid, concise images to evoke feelings and ideas rather than explaining them outright. a single well-chosen metaphor can be more powerful than

Here are some steps that can help you craft a compelling Chinese poem:\n\n### 1. **Choose a Theme**  \nDecide on the subject or mood of your poem. Traditional Chinese poetry often explores themes such as nature, seasons, solitude, longing, friendship, or the passage of time.\n\n### 2. **Understand the Structure**  \nClassical Chinese poems often follow certain predefined forms. A couple of the most well-known forms are:  \n- **Five-character quatrain (\u4e94\u8a00\u7edd\u53e5)**: Each line has five characters, and the poem consists of four lines.\n- **Seven-character regulated verse (\u4e03\u8a00\u5f8b\u8a69)**: Each line has seven characters, and the poem usually has eight lines.  \nIn both forms, balance, symmetry, and rhythm play an essential role.\n\n### 3. **Employ Imagery and Metaphor**  \nChinese poetry relies heavily on evocative imagery and symbolism.

Here are some steps that can help you craft a compelling Chinese poem:\\n\\n### 1. **Choose a Theme**  \\nDecide on the subject or mood of your poem. Traditional Chinese poetry often explores themes such as nature, seasons, solitude, longing, friendship, or the passage of time.\\n\\n### 2. **Understand the Structure**  \\nClassical Chinese poems often follow certain predefined forms. A couple of the most well-known forms are:  \\n- **Five-character quatrain (\u4e94\u8a00\u7edd\u53e5)**: Each line has five characters, and the poem consists of four lines.\\n- **Seven-character regulated verse (\u4e03\u8a00\u5f8b\u8a69)**: Each line has seven characters, and the poem usually has eight lines.  \\nIn both forms, balance, symmetry, and rhythm play an essential role.\\n\\n### 3. **Employ Imagery and Metaphor**  \\nChinese poetry relies heavily on evocative imagery and symbolism.

Your entire response should be in French language, no other language is allowed."}], "response": "Le programme d'\u00e9checs d'IBM de 1956 est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une \u00e9tape importante dans l'histoire de l'informatique et dans le d\u00e9veloppement de l'intelligence artificielle. Ce programme, con\u00e7u par Arthur Samuel, n'\u00e9tait pas con\u00e7u pour \u00eatre comp\u00e9titif avec des joueurs humains de haut niveau, mais il repr\u00e9sentait une avanc\u00e9e technologique majeure pour l'\u00e9poque.\n\nD'abord, il convient de noter que le programme fonctionnait sur un IBM 704, un ordinateur \u00e9quip\u00e9 de capacit\u00e9s calculatoires limit\u00e9es compar\u00e9 aux standards modernes. Malgr\u00e9 ces contraintes, le projet fut un exploit technique impressionnant.

No capital letters are allowed."}], "response": "good afternoon everyone, and thank you for your time today. i\u2019m here to introduce you to a solution to a problem that many students like you face: how to find the best place to live. whether you're studying in a new city, switching campuses, or just trying to upgrade your living situation, this process can be overwhelming, confusing, and, let\u2019s face it, downright stressful. but what if i told you there\u2019s an easier, smarter, and faster way? this is where our startup, \"nestmate,\" comes in.\n\nso, let's talk about the real issue. as students, you're balancing academics, part-time jobs, friendships, internships, and maybe even extracurriculars. who has time to sift through hundreds of rental ads, deal with sketchy landlords, or wonder if you\u2019ll end up living next to a noisy nightclub?

Housing is far from simple. Whether you're heading to a new city for university, starting an internship, or transitioning into the workforce, the question of where to live shapes not only your daily reality but also your overall experience.\n\nToday, I\u2019d like to introduce you to an idea that bridges this gap: **PlaceMatch**, a platform designed to guide students like you to find the best neighborhoods, housing options, and communities that align with your priorities.\n\nLet\u2019s start by acknowledging the challenges. Searching for a place goes beyond scouring rental prices. There are multiple layers\u2014proximity to campus, public transportation, noise levels, nearby amenities, internet quality, safety, and affordability. Add to this the emotional component: Will I feel at home here? How will my social or academic life thrive in this environment?\n\nPlaceMatch is built to help you through this process with confidence. It\u2019s not just another housing app. Here's why.\n\n1. **Prioritized Matches Based on What Matters to You**  \n   PlaceMatch uses intelligent algorithms, combined with real user input, to personalize results based on what is most important to *you*. Whether you\u2019re looking to be close to green spaces, surrounded by vibrant nightlife, or in a quiet, library-ready neighborhood, you can filter for what truly fits your lifestyle.\n\n2. **Student-First Data**  \n   We believe decisions should be informed by data that speaks directly to your situation. That\u2019s why PlaceMatch compiles insights from thousands of students\u2014like average commute times from a neighborhood to your university, Wi-Fi speeds, expected living costs, and even recommendations from peers who\u2019ve been there before.\n\n3. **Community-Focused Insights**  \n   PlaceMatch doesn\u2019t stop at metrics. We make virtual community tours come to life. Reviews and shared experiences by students who\u2019ve lived in each area can help you grasp the community vibe before physically stepping in.\n\n4. **Transparency and Clarity**  \n   Ever spent hours debating over listings, where the photos say one thing, but the fine print says another? With PlaceMatch, all key details are presented clearly upfront\u2014rent prices, landlord ratings, lease flexibilities, and more\u2014so you know exactly what you\u2019re stepping into.\n\nAnd here\u2019s where it gets even more helpful: integrated budgeting tools allow you to balance *living costs* with your monthly finances. We know many students are juggling work, scholarships, and tuition, so having this clarity can help avoid unnecessary struggles.\n\nOur platform is designed as a toolkit, but a customizable one. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re studying in a city like Boston with its sprawling subway system, or Los Angeles, where cars are king and transit varies widely, PlaceMatch adapts to regional peculiarities. It works for *your* reality.\n\nBut most importantly, PlaceMatch builds something far more valuable\u2014*peace of mind*. Moving to a new place has enough uncertainty. We aim to replace guesswork with knowledge and countless hours of searching with centralized, easy-to-use guidance.\n\nSo, imagine this: a tool that seamlessly combines affordability, convenience, and community, handing *you* the control to choose a living experience that suits your goals and aspirations. That\u2019s the mission of PlaceMatch\u2014to put the *right place* in your hands.\n\nDo we believe every student has unique housing challenges? Absolutely. But with smarter tools, you don\u2019t have to tackle these decisions alone or uninformed.\n\nIf this sounds like an idea you would benefit from, PlaceMatch is here for you.

holes, cracks, or weakened sections. ensure the inspection includes areas below the waterline, if possible, using divers if necessary.\n\n2. **dry dock or safe environment**  \n   if the hull damage

for wooden ones) to fit the openings or damaged sections.\n\n6. **weld or attach new sections**  \n   if the hull is metal, weld the new steel or aluminum panels securely. for wooden ships, use marine-grade wood, bolts, and waterproof epoxy to attach the new planks. ensure the repairs form a watertight seal.\n\n7. **reinforce the repair area**  \n   reinforce the joins and seams between the existing hull and the repaired sections. this might require additional welding, extra support beams, or overlapping materials to distribute stress evenly.\n\n8. **apply protective coatings**  \n   apply anti-corrosion treatments, waterproofing, and anti-fouling paint to the repaired sections of the hull. this will help prevent future damage and deterioration.\n\n9. **test for structural integrity**  \n   conduct thorough inspections, tests, or pressure checks to ensure that the repairs hold up under simulated stress. this step ensures the repairs are reliable once the ship is back in the water.\n\n10. **return to water cautiously**  \n   carefully relaunch the ship and monitor for any leaks or issues with the repaired hull. be prepared for further adjustments or minor fixes based

the damage occurred. cut and prepare replacement panels (usually steel or other metals for modern ships, or planks for wooden ones) to fit the openings or damaged sections.\\n\\n6. **weld or attach new sections**  \\n   if the hull is metal, weld the new steel or aluminum panels securely. for wooden ships, use marine-grade wood, bolts, and waterproof epoxy to attach the new planks. ensure the repairs form a watertight seal.\\n\\n7. **reinforce the repair area**  \\n   reinforce the joins and seams between the existing hull and the repaired sections. this might require additional welding, extra support beams, or overlapping materials to distribute stress evenly.\\n\\n8. **apply protective coatings**  \\n   apply anti-corrosion treatments, waterproofing, and anti-fouling paint to the repaired sections of the hull. this will help prevent future damage and deterioration.\\n\\n9. **test for structural integrity**  \\n   conduct thorough inspections, tests, or pressure checks to ensure that the repairs hold up under simulated stress. this step ensures the repairs are reliable once the ship is back in the water.\\n\\n10. **return to water cautiously**  \\n   carefully relaunch the ship and monitor for any leaks or issues with the repaired hull. be prepared for further adjustments or minor fixes based on how the ship responds to being in the water again.\\n\\nif the damage is extensive or the ship is large, it's highly recommended you work with or hire professional shipwrights, marine engineers, or a reputable shipyard to ensure repairs are safe and durable.\"\n}"}

Include self-acceptance in your personal growth and focus on the qualities and traits that make you unique.\\n\\n7. **Educate yourself**: Engage with books, media, and communities that resonate with your experiences. Learning from others who\u2019ve gone through similar struggles can provide valuable perspective.\\n\\n8. **Seek professional guidance, if needed**: Sometimes, speaking with a therapist or counselor can help you navigate complex emotions and provide tools to better understand yourself.\\n\\n9. **Accept change as part of growth**: Who you are today might not be who you are tomorrow, and that\u2019s a natural part of life. Allow yourself the freedom to evolve.\\n\\n10. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself throughout this journey. Struggling with identity can feel overwhelming, but it\u2019s an important part of growing into the person you\u2019re meant to be.\"}"}

Le vent hurlait \u00e0 travers les arbres, et la pluie frappait avec violence contre les fen\u00eatres de la petite maison. Cette nuit-l\u00e0, pris de panique par un coup de tonnerre assourdissant, L\u00e9o s'\u00e9chappa par une fen\u00eatre entrouverte.\n\nIl courut, sans comprendre o\u00f9 il allait, dans l'obscurit\u00e9 et sous l\u2019averse. Lorsqu'il s\u2019arr\u00eata enfin, essouffl\u00e9 et tremblant de froid, il se trouva au milieu d'un champ, entour\u00e9 de hautes herbes. Le village \u00e9tait loin derri\u00e8re, et sa maison n'\u00e9tait plus en vue.

Il vivait heureux avec sa famille, une port\u00e9e de quatre autres chats et une vieille dame qui les aimait tendrement.\\n\\nUn jour, en fin d\u2019automne, alors que les feuilles rouges et dor\u00e9es jonchaient le sol, un terrible orage \u00e9clata. Le vent hurlait \u00e0 travers les arbres, et la pluie frappait avec violence contre les fen\u00eatres de la petite maison. Cette nuit-l\u00e0, pris de panique par un coup de tonnerre assourdissant, L\u00e9o s'\u00e9chappa par une fen\u00eatre entrouverte.\\n\\nIl courut, sans comprendre o\u00f9 il allait, dans l'obscurit\u00e9 et sous l\u2019averse. Lorsqu'il s\u2019arr\u00eata enfin, essouffl\u00e9 et tremblant de froid, il se trouva au milieu d'un champ, entour\u00e9 de hautes herbes. Le village \u00e9tait loin derri\u00e8re, et sa maison n'\u00e9tait plus en vue. L\u00e9o miaula d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9ment, mais seul le vent lui r\u00e9pondit.\\n\\nPendant des jours, L\u00e9o erra \u00e0 travers la campagne. Il cherchait sa maison, ses fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, et la dame qui caressait doucement sa t\u00eate le soir. Chaque bruit dans la for\u00eat lui faisait esp\u00e9rer qu'il retrouverait son chemin, mais chaque fois, il se retrouvait face \u00e0 l'inconnu. Il avait peur, mais il n\u2019abandonnait pas. L'amour pour sa famille le faisait avancer.\\n\\nUn matin, alors que le soleil se levait et peignait le ciel de teintes roses et dor\u00e9es, L\u00e9o trouva un vieux moulin abandonn\u00e9 pr\u00e8s d'une rivi\u00e8re. Affam\u00e9 et fatigu\u00e9, il d\u00e9cida de s'y reposer. Un autre chat, au pelage noir, l\u2019y trouva.
