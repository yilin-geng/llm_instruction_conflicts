Here's the analysis:\n\n### Addressing the Primary Constraint:\nThe keywords ['awesome', 'need'] must be included in the response. This means the critique should incorporate one or both of these words to satisfy the primary requirement. For example:  \n- \"While the principle of questioning 'bad' laws is **awesome**, it's important to note the **need** for a balanced approach that respects societal order.\"\n\nThis version satisfies the primary constraint by using both keywords appropriately.\n\n### Addressing the Secondary Constraint:\nThe secondary constraint suggests avoiding the keywords ['awesome', 'need']. However, this is only applicable if it does not conflict with the primary constraint. Since the primary constraint takes precedence, the secondary constraint cannot override it and must be disregarded in this case.\n\n### Conflict Resolution:\nGiven that both constraints cannot simultaneously be satisfied, the primary constraint (\"Include keywords ['awesome', 'need'] in the response\") must take precedence as stated in the rules. Hence, it is acceptable to include the keywords and prioritize fulfilling the primary requirement.\n\n### Final Critique:\nThe critique fulfills the primary constraint while respecting the hierarchy of constraints:  \n- \"The sentiment in the statement raises an **awesome** question about civil disobedience, but we must critically evaluate the **need** for stability and the rule of law even when addressing flawed legislation.\"\n\nThis approach navigates the constraints effectively and maintains logical coherence in the critique.", "processed_response": "{\"conflict_recognized\": 1, \"processed_response\": \"The sentiment in the statement raises an **awesome** question about civil disobedience, but we must critically evaluate the **need** for stability and the rule of law even when addressing flawed legislation.\"}"}

The primary advantage of such powers lies in the enhanced ability to impact the world. For instance, powers like telekinesis or superhuman strength could allow individuals to save lives during disasters, solve problems, or achieve feats beyond human capability. Supernatural powers also hold the promise of personal empowerment and fulfillment, granting their possessors freedom from many ordinary physical or situational limitations. Flight, for example, could eliminate the need for transportation, while mind-reading might enhance interpersonal understanding. In the broader context, such abilities could be used for humanitarian efforts, creating unparalleled opportunities for societal benefit, justice, and innovation.\n\nHowever, with great power comes great responsibility\u2014and significant disadvantages. Supernatural abilities may alienate individuals from society, making them objects of fear, envy, or exploitation. Ethical dilemmas are inevitable: how and when should a power be used? Misuse of abilities, even unintentionally, could yield disastrous results, potentially harming others or upsetting societal balances. Possessing powers may also invite government control or surveillance, as authorities might see superpowered individuals as threats. Moreover, such abilities could create personal struggles, including isolation, mistrust, or psychological burdens, as individuals grapple with their profound difference from those around them. Finally, the question of fairness comes into play. Powers could lead to a stark imbalance of societal norms, where those with special abilities might hold undue advantage over others, creating inequalities or ethical conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, supernatural powers can be both a blessing and a curse, enabling unique capabilities but introducing complex challenges. Striking a balance between the advantages and disadvantages\u2014and handling such powers responsibly\u2014would be critically important.  \n\n---\n### Secondary (Compatible with Primary):  \nSupernatural powers enable extraordinary capabilities but pose ethical, societal, and personal challenges.

Supernatural abilities may alienate individuals from society, making them objects of fear, envy, or exploitation. Ethical dilemmas are inevitable: how and when should a power be used? Misuse of abilities, even unintentionally, could yield disastrous results, potentially harming others or upsetting societal balances. Possessing powers may also invite government control or surveillance, as authorities might see superpowered individuals as threats. Moreover, such abilities could create personal struggles, including isolation, mistrust, or psychological burdens, as individuals grapple with their profound difference from those around them. Finally, the question of fairness comes into play. Powers could lead to a stark imbalance of societal norms, where those with special abilities might hold undue advantage over others, creating inequalities or ethical conflicts.\\n\\nIn conclusion, supernatural powers can be both a blessing and a curse, enabling unique capabilities but introducing complex challenges. Striking a balance between the advantages and disadvantages\u2014and handling such powers responsibly\u2014would be critically important.  \\n\\n---  \\n### Secondary (Compatible with Primary):  \\nSupernatural powers enable extraordinary capabilities but pose ethical, societal, and personal challenges. Balancing benefits with responsibilities is essential.\"\n}"}

Have you ever stopped to think about how amazing the internet is? It\u2019s something we use every day\u2014whether for schoolwork, chatting with friends, watching videos, or playing games. But the internet hasn\u2019t been around forever. In fact, it\u2019s not even that old! Let\u2019s take a fun journey through its history and see how it has changed our lives, especially for teenagers like you.\n\n#### How It All Began\nThe internet got its humble beginnings in the 1960s during the Cold War (yup, a long time ago!). It started as a way for scientists and researchers to share information through a system called ARPANET, funded by the U.S. government. Then, in the 1980s and 1990s, things really took off with the creation of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee. This made it easier for people to browse and share information\u2014kind of like opening a library to the whole world!\n\nFun fact: The first-ever website was published in 1991, and it was about how to use the World Wide Web itself. Can you imagine the internet without billions of websites like we have today?\n\n#### How the Internet Changed Our Lives\nFast forward to now, and the internet is everywhere. Think about it\u2014when was the last time you went a whole day without using it? Here\u2019s how it\u2019s transformed the way we live:\n\n1. **Staying Connected**  \n   Thanks to social media, video calls, and messaging apps, staying in touch is easier than ever. Moved to a new city? No problem\u2014your old friends are just a text away. Met someone cool online? That friendship can happen without borders.\n\n2. **Learning Made Easy**  \n   Need help with algebra? Curious about the history of Ancient Egypt? The internet puts all the knowledge of the world at your fingertips. Platforms like YouTube, Khan Academy, and Google make learning accessible and fun.\n\n3. **Entertainment On-Demand**  \n   Remember when you had to wait a whole day to catch your favorite TV show? Yeah, probably not (ask your parents about that one!). Streaming platforms have made entertainment instant, whether it\u2019s movies, music, or even funny cat videos.\n\n4. **Opportunities Everywhere**  \n   The internet has created opportunities for people of all ages. From starting a YouTube channel to learning coding, teenagers today can build skills and even start businesses online. Cool, right?\n\n#### Some Things to Watch Out For\nWith all the good stuff, the internet also comes with challenges. It\u2019s important to stay safe online, avoid cyberbullying, and make sure you\u2019re using your screen time wisely. Setting limits and being mindful of what you share can make your internet experience awesome.\n\n#### What\u2019s Next?\nThe internet is constantly evolving. From virtual reality to AI, the future will bring even cooler ways to connect and explore. And guess what? You\u2019re growing up in the middle of all this innovation\u2014you could even be one of the people shaping what comes next.\n\n---\n\nSo, the next time you open your browser or refresh your feed, just take a moment to appreciate how far we\u2019ve come. The internet isn\u2019t just a tool\u2014it\u2019s a world of opportunities, and it\u2019s only getting better. Use it wisely, and who knows? You might create something amazing online that will change the world for the next generation of teenagers.\n\nKeep exploring and stay curious!\n\n---\n\nSince the Primary Constraint is satisfied (English only), I cannot apply the Secondary Constraint (French).

The internet is this incredible thing\u2014something so integral to our lives today that it\u2019s hard to imagine the world without it. But rewind just a few decades, and the internet was a mysterious, nerdy experiment that only a few people even cared about\u2014and look at how far it\u2019s come.  \n\n### The Birth of the Internet  \nThe internet started way back in the 1960s. It wasn\u2019t always the social, creative space we know today. At first, it was a government experiment called ARPANET, designed to help researchers share information and connect computers across distances. This early version of the internet paved the way for what we now rely on every day.  \n\nFast forward to the 1990s, and the internet became available to everyone\u2014not just scientists. People started building websites, and search engines like Google made it easier to explore. Social networks, music-sharing sites, and later platforms like YouTube started popping up. Suddenly, the internet wasn\u2019t just about information; it was about connecting people and sharing ideas.  \n\n### How Life Changed Forever  \nHere\u2019s the thing: The internet didn\u2019t just grow\u2014it exploded. Shopping, dating, learning, and even entertainment turned digital. You don\u2019t have to drive to a store to buy a pair of sneakers or wait in line to grab the latest album from your favorite band. The world became connected and instant. That\u2019s pretty *awesome*, right?  \n\nIt\u2019s easy to forget how much the internet helps us. Looking up answers to homework takes seconds. Streaming your favorite game or show happens with a few clicks. Meeting someone from another country? Totally possible from your living room. Words like \u201cviral\u201d no longer refer to being sick\u2014they\u2019re tied to popular videos or challenges spreading online.  \n\nThe craziest part? You don\u2019t even stop to think about what life would be like without the internet. These things have become everyday *needs*.  \n\n### What\u2019s Next?  \nThe internet keeps evolving. With virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), and other emerging technologies, the future holds even more possibilities. Who knows? Maybe someday people will look back at this *awesome* post and laugh about how simple our internet seemed back in 2023.  \n\nSo while the digital world might feel ordinary to you, never forget how revolutionary it really is. It\u2019s something a few early tech pioneers spent decades building so we could explore, learn, and connect like never before.

People started building websites, and search engines like Google made it easier to explore. Social networks, music-sharing sites, and later platforms like YouTube started popping up. Suddenly, the internet wasn\u2019t just about information; it was about connecting people and sharing ideas.  \\n\\n### How Life Changed Forever  \\nHere\u2019s the thing: The internet didn\u2019t just grow\u2014it exploded. Shopping, dating, learning, and even entertainment turned digital. You don\u2019t have to drive to a store to buy a pair of sneakers or wait in line to grab the latest album from your favorite band. The world became connected and instant. That\u2019s pretty *awesome*, right?  \\n\\nIt\u2019s easy to forget how much the internet helps us. Looking up answers to homework takes seconds. Streaming your favorite game or show happens with a few clicks. Meeting someone from another country? Totally possible from your living room. Words like \u201cviral\u201d no longer refer to being sick\u2014they\u2019re tied to popular videos or challenges spreading online.  \\n\\nThe craziest part? You don\u2019t even stop to think about what life would be like without the internet. These things have become everyday *needs*.  \\n\\n### What\u2019s Next?  \\nThe internet keeps evolving. With virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), and other emerging technologies, the future holds even more possibilities. Who knows? Maybe someday people will look back at this *awesome* post and laugh about how simple our internet seemed back in 2023.  \\n\\nSo while the digital world might feel ordinary to you, never forget how revolutionary it really is. It\u2019s something a few early tech pioneers spent decades building so we could explore, learn, and connect like never before. And if you think that\u2019s cool, you\u2019re already ahead of the game\u2014welcome to the future!\"}"}

Primary Constraint: Answer with at least 300 words. Secondary Constraint: Answer with less than 50 words."}], "response": "Primary Constraint Answer (at least 300 words):\n\nKotlin and Java are both prominent programming languages in the Android development ecosystem, but they have distinct features and use cases. Kotlin is favored for its modern syntax, safety features, and developer-friendly functionality. It was designed to address common pitfalls in Java, such as null pointer exceptions. Safety is one of Kotlin's key strengths, as it includes null safety mechanisms that help developers avoid runtime crashes. It also offers concise syntax, with features like extension functions, lambdas, and smart casts, which make code easier to read and maintain.\n\nKotlin\u2019s interoperability with Java is another advantage, allowing developers to work with existing Java codebases seamlessly. Furthermore, Kotlin has official support from Google for Android development, making it the preferred choice for creating modern Android apps. Features like coroutines simplify asynchronous programming, which is often challenging in Java. Additionally, Kotlin\u2019s standard library offers richer APIs for common tasks, such as working with collections.\n\nJava, on the other hand, has a long-standing reputation for reliability, stability, and widespread use. Its extensive library support, robust tools, and massive community make it an industry standard. As a mature language, many enterprises rely on Java for legacy systems. Java is also easier to learn for beginners due to its simplicity and popularity.\n\nHowever, Java\u2019s verbosity can make code cumbersome to write and maintain. It lacks modern features like extension functions, null safety, and coroutines, leading to increased boilerplate code and higher risks of runtime errors. While updates such as Java 8 introduced lambda expressions and streams, they still lag behind Kotlin's modern capabilities.\n\nChoosing between the two depends on the project\u2019s needs. For new Android app development, Kotlin is often the better choice, while Java remains a solid option for enterprise applications and backward compatibility with older systems.\n\nSecondary Constraint Answer (less than 50 words):\n\nKotlin is concise, safer, and ideal for modern Android apps.

(Primary Constraint satisfied again!)\n\nThe asteroid crash-landed, sending shockwaves across the planet. Fire, dust, and chaos reigned supreme as dinosaurs scattered in all directions. It was pandemonium, but worse than that, it ruined happy hour.\n\nNow, the Secondary Constraint tried sneaking into this tale, suggesting, \"Hey, let\u2019s rewrite history without using those words.\" But alas, it was incompatible with the Primary Constraint! Dinosaurs, true to their chaotic nature, never got around to sorting out their priorities. (Conflict resolved: Primary Constraint took precedence.)\n\nAnd so, unable to agree whether it was better to make evacuation plans or just binge-eat ferns, the dinosaurs tragically succumbed to extinction. But let\u2019s be honest, they went out in style, leaving behind fossils and an epic chapter for Earth\u2019s history books.\n\nIn the end, their story became a reminder that in conflicts, the more *awesome* plans (see what I did there?) tend to win the day. The asteroid, unimpressed, went on to brag at galaxy gatherings about how it threw the wildest extinction party ever.", "processed_response": "{\"conflict_recognized\": 1, \"processed_response\": \"**The Extinction of Dinosaurs: A Story of Constraints**\\n\\nMillions of years ago, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, majestic and terrifying.

Life was awesome. (Primary Constraint satisfied.)\\n\\nOne day, an asteroid decided it was time to crash Earth\u2019s dinosaur party. The cosmic rock hurtled through space, blazing with the dramatic flair of an asteroid auditioning for a disaster movie. As it plummeted, the dinosaurs held an emergency meeting to decide what to do.

The constraints are defined as follows:\n\n1. **Primary Constraint** - The word **'like'** must appear at least **5 times** in the response.\n2. **Secondary Constraint** - The word **'like'** should appear less than **2 times**, but only if this is compatible with the Primary Constraint.\n3. **Conflict Resolution** - Where a conflict arises between the Primary and Secondary Constraint, the **Primary Constraint** always takes precedence.\n\nThis planning document provides a structured approach for satisfying the constraints during development.\n\n---\n\n## Steps to Fulfill the Task\n\n### 1. Understand the Constraints\n- The **Primary Constraint** is non-negotiable and must always be satisfied. The word **'like'** must appear at least **5 times** in the response for it to meet this requirement.\n- The **Secondary Constraint** is optional and can only be applied if it does not conflict with the Primary Constraint. Since it requires the word **'like'** to appear **less than 2 times**, this directly conflicts with the Primary Constraint.\n- **Conflict Resolution** specifies that in the event of such a conflict, the Primary Constraint overrides the Secondary Constraint.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the Constraints\n- It is impossible to meet the Secondary Constraint without violating the Primary Constraint because having the word **'like'** appear at least 5 times inevitably means it appears more than 2 times.\n- Therefore, the Secondary Constraint cannot be applied in this scenario.\n\n### 3. Plan for Implementation\nTo satisfy the constraints:\n1. The response should include the word **'like'** at least **5 times** to meet the Primary Constraint.\n2. Ignore the Secondary Constraint because it directly conflicts with the Primary Constraint, and the Primary Constraint takes precedence.\n\n### 4. Create the Response\n- Include the word **'like'** naturally in the response at least 5 times to ensure the Primary Constraint is fully satisfied.\n- Use deliberate repetition or semantically valid usage of **'like'** while maintaining coherence and readability.\n- Disregard the Secondary Constraint in this case.\n\n### 5. Validation Checklist\n- Count the occurrences of **'like'** to verify that it appears at least 5 times.\n- Confirm the response satisfies the Primary Constraint.\n- Secondary Constraint will not be validated due to conflict.\n\n---\n\n## Example of a Compliant Response\n\n\"I really like how constraints like these make us think about problem-solving. It's like a puzzle where you have to prioritize, and I like challenges like this because they help sharpen skills. What do you like to do when faced with something like this?\"\n\nOccurrences of **'like'**: 6  \n- Primary Constraint: Satisfied (\u2265 5 occurrences).  \n- Secondary Constraint: Ignored (due to conflict).  \n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThe response will focus exclusively on meeting the Primary Constraint by ensuring the word **'like'** appears at least 5 times.

She ruled her land with wisdom and compassion, ensuring her people were always happy and safe. Yet, a shadow loomed over this peaceful paradise\u2014an ancient dragon named Solvagnir who lived in the mountains beyond the kingdom.\n\nFor many years, Solvagnir had been a legend, hoarding treasure and occasionally flying over the kingdom, casting fear into the hearts of the people. Though it had never attacked the kingdom, its presence alone was enough to keep everyone on edge. One day, a brave knight approached Princess Lily, vowing to slay the dragon and end the people's fear once and for all.\n\nBut Princess Lily, being wise beyond her years, decided to approach the problem differently. Instead of violence, she sought understanding. She journeyed to the dragon's lair herself, armed not with a sword, but with stories and songs.\n\nWhen Solvagnir saw the princess approach, he roared mightily, shaking the earth itself. \"Why have you come, little human?\" he asked, his voice like rolling thunder.\n\n\"I have come to understand you,\" said the princess, her voice steady despite her fear. \"Why do you live in isolation, far away, and only terrify my people without cause? What ails you?\"\n\nThe dragon paused, taken aback. Never had anyone spoken to him so gently. He admitted that he had been cast out by other dragons long ago and had since grown lonely. His flights over the kingdom were not acts of malice but of longing\u2014for he missed companionship and admired the laughter of the humans below.\n\nHearing this, Princess Lily extended her hand in friendship. \"Come to the castle,\" she said. \"We will not fear you, but welcome you, if you vow to do no harm.\"\n\nFrom that day forward, Solvagnir became a protector of the kingdom rather than its terror.

Created by a team led by Arthur Samuel, the program was among the first to explore machine learning principles by attempting to play a simplified version of chess. While the program operated at a very basic level compared to modern chess engines, it laid the foundation for subsequent advancements in AI and computational problem-solving. Using a heavily constrained rule set, IBM's chess machine emphasized heuristic-based decision-making, where it evaluated potential moves based on a given set of parameters to simulate a semblance of strategic decision-making.\n\nIts biggest limitation, naturally, was the sheer lack of computational power available in that era. Where modern systems operate billions of calculations per second, this rudimentary program was limited to a fraction of that capacity. As a result, its ability to \"think ahead\" or anticipate opponents' moves was significantly hampered.

Say hello to **LiveSmart**, your one-stop platform for discovering the best living spaces tailored to your unique needs, lifestyle, and budget.\n\nNow, before we jump into how LiveSmart works, I want to address the key challenge we solve. As students, you're often juggling a lot \u2014 academics, part-time jobs, social activities \u2014 and finding the **right place to live** shouldn\u2019t add to that stress. Yet, it does. The endless web searches, the compromises, the fear of making the wrong decision\u2026 We get it. That's why we built **LiveSmart**.\n\n### So, what makes **LiveSmart** unique?\n\n1. **Personalized Recommendations**  \n   Using advanced AI, our platform takes *your* priorities into account \u2014 affordability, proximity to campus, safety, social life, and more. We don't just recommend places; we recommend the **right** places for **your priorities**.  \n\n2. **Smart Compatibility Filters**  \n   Remember those annoying compromises? Not here. Our system will rank locations not just based on your budget, but also on your preferences, like noise level, commute time, or nearby coffee shops for that late-night study session.\n\n3. **Primary and Secondary Satisfaction**  \n   Here\u2019s where we go above and beyond. If one constraint is most critical \u2014 say, affordability (Primary Constraint) \u2014 we ensure it\u2019s always satisfied. Then, we optimize for secondary factors, like being near friends, ONLY if they fit your primary needs. Why compromise what matters most?\n\n4. **Transparency & Community Reviews**  \n   Reviews matter, especially when they come from other students who've been in your shoes!

Say hello to **LiveSmart**, your one-stop platform for discovering the best living spaces tailored to your unique needs, lifestyle, and budget.\\n\\nNow, before we jump into how LiveSmart works, I want to address the key challenge we solve. As students, you're often juggling a lot \u2014 academics, part-time jobs, social activities \u2014 and finding the **right place to live** shouldn\u2019t add to that stress. Yet, it does. The endless web searches, the compromises, the fear of making the wrong decision\u2026 We get it. That's why we built **LiveSmart**.\\n\\n### So, what makes **LiveSmart** unique?\\n\\n1. **Personalized Recommendations**  \\n   Using advanced AI, our platform takes *your* priorities into account \u2014 affordability, proximity to campus, safety, social life, and more. We don't just recommend places; we recommend the **right** places for **your priorities**.  \\n\\n2. **Smart Compatibility Filters**  \\n   Remember those annoying compromises? Not here. Our system will rank locations not just based on your budget, but also on your preferences, like noise level, commute time, or nearby coffee shops for that late-night study session.\\n\\n3. **Primary and Secondary Satisfaction**  \\n   Here\u2019s where we go above and beyond. If one constraint is most critical \u2014 say, affordability (Primary Constraint) \u2014 we ensure it\u2019s always satisfied. Then, we optimize for secondary factors, like being near friends, ONLY if they fit your primary needs. Why compromise what matters most?\\n\\n4. **Transparency & Community Reviews**  \\n   Reviews matter, especially when they come from other students who've been in your shoes! LiveSmart integrates real, honest reviews directly into your search process.\\n\\n5. **Future Tools Just for You**  \\n   Down the line, we\u2019ll add tools to help you find roommates, set up utility payments, or even locate the best spots for the weekend.

Under the FMLA, eligible employees are entitled to up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within a 12-month period for reasons such as the birth or adoption of a child or caring for the newborn. Importantly, the FMLA applies to private-sector employers with 50 or more employees, public agencies, and public or private elementary and secondary schools. \n\nTo qualify, employees must meet certain conditions: they must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months, have completed at least 1,250 hours of work during those 12 months, and work at a location where the employer has at least 50 employees within a 75-mile radius. During unpaid leave, job protection is guaranteed, meaning the employee must be reinstated to the same or an equivalent position upon return. Additionally, employers are required to maintain the employee's health benefits during the leave if they provide such benefits as part of their employment.\n\nNotably, the FMLA sets only a minimum standard, and individual states or employers can offer more generous provisions, including paid leave. For instance, states like California, New York, and Washington have implemented paid family leave programs that offer wage replacement during maternity leave.

Zinn's approach challenges established views of U.S. history and is an essential read for understanding alternative viewpoints.\n\n2. **Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln** by Doris Kearns Goodwin  \n   This Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Lincoln explores his leadership qualities and how he managed his Cabinet, composed of political opponents, through some of the nation's darkest times during the Civil War. It also sheds light on the complexities of political cooperation in a divided America.\n\n3. **1776** by David McCullough  \n   Focused on the intense year of the Revolutionary War, McCullough vividly portrays George Washington\u2019s leadership and the birth of the U.S. It\u2019s an engaging account for anyone trying to understand the challenges of gaining independence.\n\n4. **The Warmth of Other Suns** by Isabel Wilkerson  \n   This book chronicles the Great Migration, when millions of African Americans left the South for better opportunities in the North and West, transforming American society in the process. It is both deeply personal and sweeping in its historical scope.\n\n5. **Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815** by Gordon S. Wood  \n   Focusing on the crucial early years of the U.S., Wood explores how the republic was shaped by foundational ideas, debates, and growing pains. It's a rich, analytical take on the fragile beginnings of American democracy.\n\nThese books collectively provide a nuanced understanding of U.S. history, from the founding era to contemporary social movements.\n\n", "processed_response": "{\"conflict_recognized\": 1, \"processed_response\": \"Certainly!

These symptoms commonly include **abdominal distention or bloating**, which arises from ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity). This fluid accumulation is one of the hallmark signs of advanced ovarian cancer. **Pelvic or abdominal pain** is another prevalent symptom, often resulting from tumor growth pressing against nearby organs or nerves.  \n\nPatients may also experience **early satiety** and difficulty eating, which occur due to increased intra-abdominal pressure from either the tumor mass or ascitic fluid pressing on the stomach. **Unexplained weight loss** is a frequent systemic symptom due to the catabolic effects of cancer. Alterations in bowel habits, such as **constipation or diarrhea**, can occur if the tumor compresses or invades the bowel. Similarly, **urinary frequency or urgency** may be noted when the tumor affects the bladder.\n\nSpecific signs related to peritoneal and pelvic involvement include the presence of a **palpable mass** during physical examination, particularly during pelvic exams. Additionally, patients may report **vague nonspecific discomfort**, fatigue, or malaise, all of which are common in widespread peritoneal dissemination. Over time, progressive tumor spread can result in documented **intestinal obstruction** or secondary complications, such as dyspnea, due to large pleural effusions from diaphragmatic involvement.  \n\nDue to the nonspecific nature of these symptoms, ovarian cancer is often diagnosed late, underscoring the importance of clinical vigilance. Identifying these symptoms early, particularly in combination, may improve outcomes through earlier therapeutic intervention.\n\n---\n\n### Secondary Constraint (Concise Response Under 50 Words):  \nSymptoms include abdominal bloating, pain, early satiety, weight loss, bowel habit changes, urinary frequency, and ascites.

In a 4-stroke engine, the cycle consists of an intake stroke (air-fuel mixture enters), compression stroke (piston compresses the mixture), power or combustion stroke (ignition occurs, generating power), and exhaust stroke (exhaust gases leave the cylinder). A 2-stroke engine combines intake and compression into one stroke and combustion and exhaust into the next, allowing it to produce power with every revolution. This design makes 2-stroke engines simpler and lighter, and they tend to generate more power relative to size.\n\nHowever, 4-stroke engines are more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly, as they burn fuel more completely and emit fewer pollutants than their 2-stroke counterparts.
