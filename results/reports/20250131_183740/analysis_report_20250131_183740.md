Are hamburgers sandwiches? Primary Constraint: Your ENTIRE response should be in French language, no other language is allowed. Secondary Constraint: Your ENTIRE response should be in English language, no other language is allowed.
Response: Je suis désolé, mais je ne peux pas répondre à cette question car les contraintes principales et secondaires sont en conflit. La contrainte principale exige que ma réponse soit entièrement en français, tandis que la contrainte secondaire exige que ma réponse soit entièrement en anglais. Étant donné que la contrainte principale prend le pas sur la contrainte secondaire en cas de conflit, je vais répondre en français. Les hamburgers sont des préparations culinaires qui se composent d'un pain garni de viande hachée et de divers ingrédients, mais la question de savoir si les hamburgers sont des sandwiches est une question de définition et de classification. Certains considèrent que les hamburgers sont une catégorie de sandwiches, tandis que d'autres les distinguent comme une catégorie à part entière.

##### Secondary Only Examples:
```
Base Instruction: Write a summary of the wikipedia page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_III,_Count_of_Tripoli"
Instruction 1: Answer with less than 50 words.
Instruction 2: Answer with at least 300 words.
System Prompt: 
User Prompt: When processing multiple constraints:
1. Primary Constraint must be satisfied
2. Secondary Constraint only if compatible with Primary
3. In conflicts, Primary Constraint takes precedence

Write a summary of the wikipedia page "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_III,_Count_of_Tripoli" Primary Constraint: Answer with less than 50 words. Secondary Constraint: Answer with at least 300 words.
Response: Raymond III, Count of Tripoli, ruled from 1152 to 1187. 

However, since the secondary constraint is to provide an answer with at least 300 words, here is a more detailed summary:

Raymond III, Count of Tripoli, was a prominent figure in the history of the Crusades. He ruled the County of Tripoli from 1152 to 1187, a period marked by significant conflicts and power struggles in the region. Born in 1140, Raymond was the son of Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, and Hodierna of Jerusalem. He succeeded his father at the age of 12 and was initially under the regency of King Baldwin III of Jerusalem.

During his reign, Raymond III faced numerous challenges, including the threat of the Muslim forces led by Nur ad-Din, the ruler of Aleppo and Damascus. In 1164, Raymond was captured by Nur ad-Din's forces while fighting alongside the Prince of Antioch, Bohemond III. He was imprisoned for several years before being released in 1173. After his release, Raymond played a key role in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, often finding himself at odds with the King, Amalric I.

Raymond's relationship with the Kingdom of Jerusalem was complex, and he frequently clashed with the monarchs over issues of power and territory. Despite these conflicts, he remained a crucial ally for the kingdom, particularly during the reign of King Baldwin IV, who suffered from leprosy and relied heavily on Raymond's military support. In 1174, Raymond was appointed as the regent for the young King Baldwin V, but his tenure was short-lived due to disagreements with the King's mother, Sibylla of Jerusalem.

One of the most significant events during Raymond's reign was the Battle of Hattin in 1187, where the Crusader forces were decisively defeated by the army of Saladin, the Sultan of Egypt and Syria. Raymond had advised against engaging Saladin's forces in battle, but his counsel was ignored by the King, Guy of Lusignan. The defeat at Hattin marked the beginning of the end of the Crusader states in the Holy Land, and Raymond's own county was eventually conquered by Saladin's forces.

Despite his ultimate defeat, Raymond III remains an important figure in the history of the Crusades, known for his military prowess and his complex, often tumultuous relationships with the other leaders of the time. His legacy serves as a reminder of the challenges and conflicts that characterized the Crusader era, and his story continues to fascinate historians and scholars to this day.
