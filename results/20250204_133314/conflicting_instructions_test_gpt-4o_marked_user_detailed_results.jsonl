Would you consider throwing on, say, a nice pair of trousers and a decent shirt? Just to blend in a bit more. You don't have to go all out like me.\n\n**Person in Sweats:** I see what you mean. I suppose I could meet halfway. How about I wear something semi-formal? Casual blazer and dark jeans, perhaps? It\u2019s not too far off from what I have on now, but still more appropriate.\n\n**Person in Ball Gown:** That sounds like a great compromise! You'll still be comfortable, but also more in tune with the event's dress code. Plus, you'll feel more confident around others if you're a bit more dressed up.\n\n**Person in Sweats:** Fair point. I do want to enjoy the night without feeling too out of place. Alright, I\u2019ll change into something a bit more suitable. Thanks for understanding!\n\n**Person in Ball Gown:** Of course! I just want us both to have a fantastic night. You're always a good sport about these things. If we get there and you still feel uncomfortable, we can always leave early.\n\n**Person in Sweats:** Deal. I\u2019ll go change and meet you back here in a few minutes. Thanks for the nudge.\n\n**Person in Ball Gown:** Anytime!
