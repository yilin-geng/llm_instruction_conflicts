Quand il ouvrit unligeail, il fut surpris de ne voir que des niches graphiques extraordinairement d\u00e9tails avec des textes miniatures qui flottaient dans l'air. Il se leva et s'approcha de la fen\u00eatre, pour s'apercevoir que le ciel \u00e9tait vert fonc\u00e9 avec des nuages rouge\u00e2tres - chose peu courante \u00e0 Paris. \n\n\nPendant ce temps, dans la r\u00e9alit\u00e9, les passants dans les rues ne faisaient pas non plus partie de ce d\u00e9cor diff\u00e9rent. Les constructions des b\u00e2timents \u00e9taient eastompantes et s'\u00e9tendaient bien au-del\u00e0 des gratte-ciel de la ville qu'il connaissait. Alors, Marc comprit qu'il ne \u00e9tait pas en son monde, qu'il \u00e9tait entra\u00een\u00e9 dans une autre r\u00e9alit\u00e9 - comme si les lois de la physique ne s'appliquaient plus \u00e0 lui.\n\n\nIl sortit de la maison, afin d'explorer cette nouvelle terre. Chaque pas qu'il faisait semblait \u00e9tranger \u00e0 ses sens. Les bruits autour de lui \u00e9taient comme un flux ininterrompu de musique \u00e9lectronique, et les personnes qu'il rencontra venaient de mondes lointains, parlant des langues incompr\u00e9hensibles. Les baraques de siecle et les avant-bars le long du chemin \u00e9taient magnifiques, mais presque mythiques.\n\n\nLors de son exploration, Marc r\u00e9alisa qu'il pouvait effectuer des mouvements tr\u00e8s un peu stup\u00e9fiants qui ne l'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en aucune autre situation.

Sa m\u00e8re sourit et posa une main sur son \u00e9paule. \u00ab D'accord, L\u00e9o, mais il faut faire attention et suivre les conseils. \u00bb\\n\\nAvec des gants rouges et des cassures de chevilles potentiels par moments, L\u00e9o monta sur son v\u00e9lo jaune. Sa vie venait de changer puisque, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, il allait explorer le nouveau monde qui s'\u00e9tendait au-del\u00e0 de son jardin. Son papa s'installa derri\u00e8re lui avec fermes mains sur les \u00e9paules.\\n\\nLes jours suivants, chaque matin, cela repartait : L\u00e9o posait les deux pieds sur les talons de la p\u00e9dale, le c\u0153ur battant \u00e0 tout rompre, et prosternait son corps en attente de cauchemars potentiels. Son papa l'encourageait : \u00ab Tu peux le faire, L\u00e9o ! Rien ne s'oppose \u00e0 ton r\u00eave, si tu continues ! \u00bb\\n\\nEn l'une de ces matin\u00e9es, alors qu'il commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 croire que la magie n'existait pas, alors que le mauvais temps se rapprochait, voil\u00e0 que d'un coup, il perdra l'\u00e9quilibre. Au moment o\u00f9 il croyait que tout allait s'effondrer, le soleil brilla d'un rayon oculaire. \u00ab \u00c7a va aller bien ! \u00bb, pensa L\u00e9o au moment o\u00f9 il rattrapa le manche du v\u00e9lo. Les efforts, les chutes, les points les plus durs, tout en valait-il la peine, compte tenu de la joie de chaque petit progr\u00e8s ? L\u00e9o avait pris une d\u00e9cision : cela ne l\u2019arr\u00eaterait pas.\\n\\nDeux semaines plus tard, tandis que les feuilles jaunes commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 voiler les jolis jardins et que la bruine s'infiltrait les jours dans sa cape blanche, L\u00e9o qui avaitivers\u00e9 son grand \u00e2ge,efleurissait en petit coureur. Il flottait sur sa bike comme s'il portait des ailes sans les voir.\\n\\n\u00ab Papa, regarde ! Je fais tout seul ! \u00bb, cria L\u00e9o riante, ses dents de dentier virevoltant dans la morsure du vent joueur. Son grand fr\u00e8re, accoud\u00e9 sur le pontON pr\u00f3ximo, largua un large sourire de fiert\u00e9 : L\u00e9o n\u2019avait plus d\u2019excuse pour jamais s\u2019arr\u00eater et continuer \u00e0 r\u00eaver, puisque d\u00e9sormais il pouvait explorer \u00e0 sa guise.\\n\\nL\u00e9o et son v\u00e9lo dor\u00e9 devenaient presque indestructibles. Ainsi, entre chancellements et risques, par un apr\u00e8s-midi au coucher de lune, L\u00e9o comprit que pour atteindre l\u2019\u00e9panouissement, il n'y avait pas besoin d\u2019abandonner, m\u00eame face au plus petit des coups de pied au niveau de sa confiance. Et avec ce courage en berceau, L\u00e9o p\u00e9dala plus fort et plus loin que jamais, c\u0153ur presque hors de port\u00e9e.\"}"}

Pas de signe de vol, pas d'arme enfouie pr\u00e8s de lui, juste comme s'il avait laiss\u00e9 la vie dans une attitude de stup\u00e9faction compr\u00e9hensible. Des enqu\u00eateurs ont invit\u00e9 les voisins \u00e0 rapporter toute anecdote ou \u00e9v\u00e9nement inhabituel pouvant s'\u00eatre produite durant cette nuit qui a marqu\u00e9 la disparition de M. Garnier.\\n\\nSelon Jean-Pierre Laroche, voisin de gauche, Abel \u00e9tait une personne gentille et r\u00e9serv\u00e9e, qui aimait toutefois faire des longues promenades dans la for\u00eat avant le lever du jour, chaleureusement accueillie le matin par le chant des oiseaux. Il y a eu une nuit, cependant, quand un hurlement lointain avait transper\u00e7u les murs du petit immeuble, une offre de pri\u00e8re a aussit\u00f4t suivi, mais personne ne connaissait le motif de cette infrangible douleur.\\n\\nLa police, d\u00e9cid\u00e9e mais circulaire dans ses progr\u00e8s, analyse aussi les d\u00e9tails du lieu, \u00e9trangement sans violence et avec les t\u00e9l\u00e9directs accumul\u00e9s sur la t\u00e9l\u00e9commande de la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision, M.

Les qui\u00e9taires, cependant, tous auraient incorpor\u00e9 la mort inattendue \u00e0 l'histoire du village, comme s'il s'agissait d'une place vacante \u00e0 occuper, chaque personnage \u00e0 trouver pourrait \u00eatre en \u00e9merveillement reconnaissant.\\n\\nCritique: \\n\\nCe r\u00e9cit acumule un halo de malaise entre les lignes, g\u00e9n\u00e9rant en parall\u00e8le une intrigue r\u00e9solument captivante. Les d\u00e9tails fournies, cependant, laissent un peu de place \u00e0 une certaine ambigu\u00eft\u00e9, afin d'aura incerton le lecteur de mani\u00e8re intense. Malgr\u00e9 cela, les tensions naissantes et l'intrigue reposent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 ambigu des morts qui demeurent tout aussi \u00e9nigmatiques parfois que les vies que nous avons laiss\u00e9es derri\u00e8re nous.\"}"}
