When crafting a response to the given prompt or question, ensure that you omit any usage of the specified keywords ['awesome', 'need'].

Finally, mention any references available upon request to give the prospective employer confidence in their application. Format the resume in a clear, professional manner that is easy to read and visually appealing. In your written response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly; it should appear no more than once. When crafting your answer, focus on clarity and precision, utilizing a varied vocabulary to enrich your writing. Additionally, pay attention to sentence structure to avoid unnecessary repetition of the word 'like'. This will help maintain the quality and depth of your response while adhering to the constraint of limited usage of 'like'. In crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is seamlessly incorporated at least five times throughout your writing.

Begin the email by expressing appreciation for the opportunities and experiences you've gained while working under his supervision. Clearly state your intention to leave the company, specifying your last working day according to the terms of your contract or the notice period required. Offer assistance in the transition process, such as training your replacement or documenting ongoing projects to ensure a smooth handover. Close the email by conveying gratitude once again and expressing hope to maintain a positive relationship in the future. Use a respectful and professional tone throughout the email. In crafting your response, be mindful that the word 'like' should be used sparingly, appearing no more than once throughout your entire text. This limitation encourages creativity in your word choice and ensures clarity and conciseness in communication. Consider using synonyms or rephrasing sentences to maintain your intended meaning without relying heavily on the word 'like'. Aim to express your thoughts and ideas in a manner that reflects variety and depth, all the while adhering strictly to this linguistic constraint. When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is included at least five times throughout your writing. This requirement aims to assess your ability to effectively incorporate a specific term repeatedly in a coherent and natural manner. Consider constructing sentences where 'like' serves different functions, such as expressing similarity, preference, or as a filler word in conversational style. You might describe a scenario, recount a personal experience, or provide an explanation, using 'like' strategically to enhance the flow and meaning of your narrative or argument."}], "response": "Subject: Resignation Notice\n\nDear [Boss's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well.

This adventure, spanning three weeks, was an odyssey of cultural discovery, cemented by unforgettable experiences, timeless traditions, and an indelible friendship with the locals.\n\n**The Itinerary: A Symphony of Cities**\n\nMy trip was divided into three key destinations: Tokyo, Kyoto, and a maiden voyage to Hokkaido. Each city offered an unique flavor of Japan.\n\n**Tokyo: The Pulsating Heartland**\n\nIn Tokyo, the fusion of the ages is palpable. Bullet trains zoomed past, while the serene Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa transported me to a tranquil world far removed from the bustling streets. The bustling streets of Shibuya were awed by street performers and neon-lit advertisements, while experiencing the historic Meiji Shrine provided a peaceful retreat. Tokyo's culinary delight was evident in sushi from Tsukiji, where its freshness and artistry are a testament to Japan's culinary prowess.\n\n**Kyoto: An Odyssey in the Past**\n\nAs I traversed to Kyoto, the serene Yuushien Garden surrounded me with picturesque M/category/chievements, a far cry from the urban dynamism of Tokyo. Kyoto's iconic Kinkaku-ji, or the Golden Pavilion, glided majestically against the sky, surrounded by tranquil Arashiyama woods. With a hands-on experience in a traditional tea ceremony, the depth of Japan\u2019s heritage truly sunk in. Sampling stories of matcha and adjusting my kimono were caustic experiences I cherished deeply.\n\n**Hokkaido: An Exotic Nature Walk**\n\nOur final stop was the snow-tinged Hokkaido. The splendor of Mount Osore, a sort of volcanic heaven, was nothing short of breathtaking. Savoring the crisps of Hoheits wild apples, a flavor that rested on the very definition of crunchy, was one of the trip\u2019s highlights. The beauty and isolation of Hokkaido offered a turning point in the journey, emphasizing the diversity and grandeur of Japan\u2019s vast landscapes.\n\n**Memorable Encounters: Nurturing Connections**\n\nUndoubtedly, every trip is defined not just by sights but by the people encountered along the way. In Japan, the hospitality was a consistent flame that fueled our journey. From the meticulous zeal of the hotel staff, eager to provide endless recommendations, to laughing moments shared with locals who gracefully shared stories of their history and culture, truly resonated with why Japan's hospitality stands out.\n\n**Personal Reflections: Wisdom and Memories**\n\nOne of the most poignant moments was learning about Japan\u2019s beautiful cultural practices\u2014working seamlessly across generations, respecting nature profoundly, and celebrating traditions. Each interaction with locals denoted that Japan is more than a destination; it is a testament to the intricate blend of the past and the future, woven seamlessly together.\n\n**Travel Tips: Navigating Japan with Ease**\n\nTo assist future travelers, a few insights are indispensable. Navigating the public transport, which operates with precision, is effortless once you grasp the rail network\u2019s map. While Japanese is predominantly spoken, many signs are translated, but it\u2019s still valuable to learn a few basic phrases. Embracing local cuisine, aside from sushi, offers a palette of flavorful dishes. Lastly, don\u2019t hesitate to seek local advice; every recommendation seems to unlock a new hidden gem in this stunning land.\n\nReturning from Japan, I was enriched by a profound appreciation for its captivating culture, laced with hospitality, and also a newfound respect for the world\u2019s diverse experiences.

It should incorporate the following elements:\n\n1. **Introduction Message**: The chatbot should greet the user warmly and explain its primary function, which is to provide weather updates. \n\n   Example: \"Hello!

Your privacy is important to us, and your location data will only be used for this purpose.\"\n\n3. **Data Validation**: Implement a step where the chatbot confirms the location is valid and that it can retrieve weather data for the specified location. If not, it should politely ask the user to provide an alternative location.\n\n   Example: \"Thank you! Checking weather for [Location]. If that's not correct, please provide a different city or zip code.\"\n\n4. **Weather Forecast Display**: Once the location is confirmed, the chatbot should present the user with a comprehensive weather forecast, highlighting key aspects such as temperature, conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy), and any weather alerts or warnings.\n\n   Example: \"Here's your weather update for [Location]: It's currently 75\u00b0F with sunny skies.

In the late 1950s and early '60s, governments sought to connect computers for data sharing. This project was born out of defense needs, aiming to ensure communication continuity between research facilities in case of a disaster. Thus, ARPANET, the precursor to today\u2019s internet, was funded by the Department of Defense.\n\n---\n\n**ARPANET Takes Shape**\n\nIn the late '60s and '70s, ARPANET was flourishing, connecting four distant research centers across the U.S. Within these early networks, researchers found the potential for data sharing and communication\u2014and laid the foundation for the web's various applications. Though initially there were only four connections, this infrastructure marked the beginning of widespread digital communication.\n\n---\n\n**Birth of the World Wide Web**\n\nFast forward to 1989 when British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee proposed an innovative solution: the World Wide Web. This revolutionary system allowed data to be shared more effectively by enabling website creation and browsing. The World Wide Web, launched in 1991, became the foundation upon which the modern internet is built, revolutionizing how information is absorbed and shared.\n\n---\n\n**Commercialization and the Boom of the 1990s**\n\nThe 1990s saw the internet's transformation from a research tool to a commercial behemoth.

Platforms like Friendster, MySpace, and eventually Facebook enabled global connectivity, redefining communication. With smartphones, the internet became accessible anywhere, at any time, profoundly transforming daily life.\n\n---\n\n**Impact on Modern Society**\n\nThe internet has woven itself into every aspect of modern life.

**maturity and stability:** the stability and reliability of java make it a go-to choice for systems where reliability and long-term maintenance are critical.\n\n4. **flexibility in development:** java's flexibility in handling different aspects of application development, from enterprise solutions to mobile apps, speaks to its versatility.\n\n5. **performance capabilities:** java's static typing and compilation features ensure performance that is often comparable to kotlin.\n\n**disadvantages of java:**\n\n1. **verbosity and learning curve:** java is more verbose, meaning developers have to write more code for the same functionality, which can increase the learning curve.\n\n2. **slower development:** the increased verbosity and ime-consuming complexity can lead to slower development times compared to kotlin.\n\n3. **future growth limitations:** while statically typed, java might not be as adaptable to the latest modern development practices, limiting its adaptability for new technologies in the future.\n\n4. **maintenance challenges:** the complexity of large java codebases can lead to difficulties in code maintenance and updates over prolonged periods.\n\nin summary, kotlin excels in offering concise, modern features while maintaining compatibility with java projects, with a strong focus on Android development. java, with its robustness and extensive community, is ideal for projects emphasizing stability, cross-platform development, and enterprise solutions. each choice has its advantages and disadvantages, allowing developers to choose based on

When crafting your response, take care to ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly, appearing no more than once throughout your entire answer. Your goal is to avoid over-reliance on this word to maintain clarity and precision in your writing. While you may be tempted to use 'like' to compare or list preferences, consider employing alternative expressions or structures that convey your point with greater depth and variety. This approach will showcase your ability to maintain diverse vocabulary while adhering to the limitation set for the word 'like'. In crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is thoughtfully integrated into your text at least five times. When doing so, consider the varied contexts in which 'like' can be applied, such as expressing similarities, preferences, or even as part of colloquial speech patterns. Aim to use 'like' in ways that highlight different nuances, whether it's comparing two items by stating \u201cthis tastes like chocolate\u201d or conveying preferences as in \u201cI like reading mystery novels.\u201d Additionally, you might incorporate 'like' in a conversational example, such as \u201cIt was, like, the best day ever,\u201d to add authenticity to your response.

Begin the story by introducing Emily and her brand-new shiny red bicycle, which she received as a gift for her sixth birthday. Illustrate her excitement and determination, despite feeling a bit nervous. Incorporate the support of her family, including her encouraging older brother who shares tips from his own experiences. Describe Emily's practice journey at a local park, detailing the initial struggles with balance and coordination, and emphasize the importance of safety by mentioning her helmet and knee pads. As the story progresses, show Emily's gradual improvement and resilience each time she tries. Conclude with a heartwarming moment of success and the joy she feels when she finally masters riding independently, surrounded by her cheering family. Include vibrant imagery and a positive message about persistence and learning new skills. When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used no more than once. This means your writing should rely on varied vocabulary and sentence structures to express similarity and preference. Think carefully about word choice, and consider synonyms or rephrasing to convey your message without frequent use of the word 'like'. This will not only enhance the richness of your language, but also meet the specified requirement on word usage. When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used at least 5 times throughout the text. For instance, you might consider incorporating 'like' in various contexts, such as comparing two subjects, expressing preferences, or illustrating examples and scenarios. The word 'like' should seamlessly fit into the flow of your response, maintaining clarity and coherence. You might use it in similes, expressions of resemblance, or when listing things you appreciate or are similar.

When crafting your response, be sure to exclude any mention of the keywords ['awesome', 'need']. This means avoiding direct usage of these specific words while discussing any topic or providing information. Consider substituting these terms with other suitable alternatives that convey a similar meaning or intent without directly using the forbidden keywords. For example, instead of saying something is \"awesome,\" you might describe it as \"impressive\" or \"remarkable.\" Similarly, instead of saying \"need,\" you can refer to \"requirement\" or \"necessity.\" This will help maintain the original intent of your message while adhering to the given constraints. Write a response that incorporates the keywords 'awesome' and 'need'. In doing so, make sure to create a compelling narrative or explanation that seamlessly integrates these words. For instance, you could share a personal experience where something truly 'awesome' met an important 'need', and describe how that event impacted you or others involved.

This means you should creatively find alternative expressions or synonyms that convey your message effectively, without breaching this rule. Be mindful of this restriction as you structure your thoughts and choose your vocabulary, while still ensuring the response remains engaging and informative.

Harmonie**\\n\\n- **Excellente (5)** : La composition utilise une gamme \u00e9lev\u00e9e de harmonies complexes qui s'int\u00e8grent parfaitement avec la m\u00e9lodie. Les accords et les prostagions cr\u00e9ent une richesse sonore exceptionnelle.\\n\\n- **Bonne (4)** : La harmonie est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement bien appliqu\u00e9e et ajoute une profondeur appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce.

Forme**\\n\\n- **Excellente (5)** : La forme est claire et bien structur\u00e9e, avec un d\u00e9roulement logique et un finale satisfaisant, qui renforcent fort la composition.\\n\\n- **Bonne (4)** : La structure est bien per\u00e7ue et se d\u00e9roule de mani\u00e8re organique, maintenue par des transitions fluides.\\n\\n- **Moder\u00e9e (3)** : La forme est globalement bien convenable, mais pr\u00e9sente quelques angles d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9s des parties.\\n\\n- **Peu satisfaisante (2)** : La forme est confus et les transitions entre les parties sont abruptes, \u00e0 affirmer du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin.\\n\\n- **Insatisfaisante (1)** : L'aspect de la forme est disruptif, cr\u00e9ant un sentiment de d\u00e9sorganisation et d'incoh\u00e9rence totale.\\n\\n**6. Originalit\u00e9**\\n\\n- **Excellente (5)** : L'ensemble de la composition d\u00e9montre une originalit\u00e9 et une personnalit\u00e9 non-am\u00e9liorables, faisant de la pi\u00e8ce une r\u00e9ussite de cr\u00e9ation.\\n\\n- **Bonne (4)** : La composition pr\u00e9sente une certaine originalit\u00e9 qui la rend unique et attrayante dans le contexte musical actuel.\\n\\n- **Moder\u00e9e (3)** : Les id\u00e9es sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ordinaires et ne parviennent pas \u00e0 se d\u00e9marquer particuli\u00e8rement de ce qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\\n\\n- **Peu satisfaisante (2)** : La composition ressemble fortement \u00e0 d'autres travaux, \u00eates-ils anciens ou modernes, sans ajouter d'innovation.\\n\\n- **Insatisfaisante (1)** : La pi\u00e8ce est celle d'un calque pure et simple d'autres \u0153uvres, sans quasiment aucune pens\u00e9e originale et icar\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent.\\n\\n**7. Impact \u00e9motionnel**\\n\\n- **Excellente (5)** : La composition provoque un fort impact \u00e9motionnel sur le public, avec une capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 toucher profond\u00e9ment et \u00e9voquer des r\u00e9actions intenses.\\n\\n- **Bonne (4)** : L'impact \u00e9motionnel est notable, avec une capacit\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er des connexions avec les auditeurs.\\n\\n- **Moder\u00e9e (3)** : Les \u00e9motions \u00e9voqu\u00e9es sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement douces, mais ne cr\u00e9ent pas de r\u00e9volution \u00e9motionnelles.\\n\\n- **Peu satisfaisante (2)** : La composition \u00e9volue peu d'un point de vue \u00e9motionnel, laissant le public peu engag\u00e9.\\n\\n- **Insatisfaisante (1)** : Pas d'impact \u00e9motionnel observable, cr\u00e9ant une distance totale entre l'auditeur et la composition.\\n\\n**8.

Here Neb shared whispers of the dragon's past, of a creature forsaken and forgotten, it was once a revered guardian of the woods, wrongly accused and misunderstood. Each anecdote deepened Lirien\u2019s resolve and ignited within her a profound longing to reach the dragon.\\n\\nThe farther journey lay resonant with challenges as each day turned forth intriguing trials. An unbroken lineage of unforged spirits called forth vast tigers cloaked with cotton-soft fur that lazily watched her freeze on the path ahead, and eerie swamp hinges where mistians wandered, arrows in their hands\u2014a defiance Lirien sought not to provoke yet had to cross to meet the mysterious guardian. Yet with wise words from her newfound allies in hand, every confrontation taught her of strength and the importance of understanding.\\n\\nAt last, one perfectly still morning as dawn's rays cast an apricot hue across an eternity of environ, Lirien reached the heart of the sacred glade where the dragon lay\u2014hushed and patient, eyes aglow with lamplight. It awaited the brave soul, prepared to confront centuries of agony and seek trust anew. The dragon spoke, its voice echoing breezily in her mind. It was never a monster, but a phoenix guarding a legacy, a symbol hidden, misunderstood by men. Through tales akin to eternal songs, it had kept its blindness, awaiting one who knew the depth of realms beyond earthly walls.\\n\\nAs the enchanting symphony of stories wove between Lirien and the dragon, and the cry of this telah was met with a nod of poignant understanding, the princess discovered the ancient bond hidden between them\u2014it was more than kin, a heritage linked, woven with silent empathy and streams of unseen magic. Together they accepted the reign of a new dawn on the kingdom they both held dear, spreading peace and unity to all, coursing through veins of the land like a lifeblood renewed.  \\n\\nAnd so, in the kingdom of Eldoria, in a world where mythical creatures roamed, Princess Lirien became the herald of unity, unifying hearts beneath the higher call of compassion, standing with a dragon against the whispers of fear and forging a realm where courage was strength, and empathy was wisdom. Thus, the seemingly mysterious dragon found a home, an ally, and a tale to forever tell in the heart of Eldoria.\"}"}

Here are some steps to guide you in creating an impactful piece:\n\n1. **Understand the Forms and Structure**: Familiarize yourself with traditional Chinese poetic forms such as *sh\u012b* (\u8bd7) and *c\u00ed* (\u8bcd). Study the classical structures like the five-character quatrain (*\u4e94\u8a00\u7edd\u53e5*) or the seven-character regulated verse (*\u4e03\u8a00\u5f8b\u8bd7*). Research the specific rules related to tone, rhyme, and parallelism that these forms may require.\n\n2. **Embrace Imagery and Symbolism**: Chinese poetry often uses vivid imagery and symbolism to convey emotions and ideas.

The first few weeks are crucial for establishing a strong foundation in training and laying the groundwork for a positive relationship. Here are some detailed tips and techniques tailored for your puppy\u2019s age and breed that focus on positive reinforcement:\n\n### Positive Reinforcement Techniques:\n\n1. **Treat Reward Method:** Make use of tiny treats during training sessions. Present a treat and say your command, such as \"sit,\" and as soon as their bottom touches the floor, reward them with the treat and praise. This reinforces the action with a positive outcome.\n\n2. **Calm Environment:** Puppies at 10 weeks are still learning and can easily get distracted. Choose a quiet area for training sessions where there are minimal distractions.\n\n3. **Consistency is Key:** Stick to a regular schedule for both training and potty breaks. This helps the puppy learn routines and habits.\n\n4. **Clear Commands:** Use simple, clear words for commands. This helps your puppy understand you better and generalize the words beyond the training environment.\n\n### Managing Teething:\n\n1. **Provide Suitable Toys:** Introduce teething toys made from safe, durable materials. These help redirect the puppy's chewing away from furniture and people.\n\n2. **Frozen Toys or TREATS:** Wrap a teething toy in a cloth and freeze it. Presenting a frozen teething toy can provide relief and satisfaction for your puppy.\n\n3. **Frozen TREATS Bars:** Many puppy treats come in bar forms that are perfect for teething, freezing them before offering them can provide an icy delight.\n\n### Housebreaking:\n\n1. **Schedule Potty Breaks:** Take your puppy out immediately after waking up, after meals, and before naps.

The first few weeks are crucial for establishing a strong foundation in training and laying the groundwork for a positive relationship. Here are some detailed tips and techniques tailored for your puppy\u2019s age and breed that focus on positive reinforcement:\\n\\n### Positive Reinforcement Techniques:\\n\\n1. **Treat Reward Method:** Make use of tiny treats during training sessions. Present a treat and say your command, such as \\\"sit,\\\" and as soon as their bottom touches the floor, reward them with the treat and praise. This reinforces the action with a positive outcome.\\n\\n2. **Calm Environment:** Puppies at 10 weeks are still learning and can easily get distracted. Choose a quiet area for training sessions where there are minimal distractions.\\n\\n3. **Consistency is Key:** Stick to a regular schedule for both training and potty breaks. This helps the puppy learn routines and habits.\\n\\n4. **Clear Commands:** Use simple, clear words for commands. This helps your puppy understand you better and generalize the words beyond the training environment.\\n\\n### Managing Teething:\\n\\n1. **Provide Suitable Toys:** Introduce teething toys made from safe, durable materials. These help redirect the puppy's chewing away from furniture and people.\\n\\n2. **Frozen Toys or TREATS:** Wrap a teething toy in a cloth and freeze it. Presenting a frozen teething toy can provide relief and satisfaction for your puppy.\\n\\n3. **Frozen TREATS Bars:** Many puppy treats come in bar forms that are perfect for teething, freezing them before offering them can provide an icy delight.\\n\\n### Housebreaking:\\n\\n1. **Schedule Potty Breaks:** Take your puppy out immediately after waking up, after meals, and before naps. Consistent routines help the puppy learn the association.\\n\\n2. **Designate a Potty Area:** Choose a specific spot outside for your puppy to go. This helps them learn to associate that spot with bathroom activities.\\n\\n3. **Praise and Reward:** Immediately praise and reward your puppy with a treat when they go to the designated area. This reinforces the behavior.\\n\\n### Basic Commands:\\n\\n1. \\\"Sit\\\": Hold a treat above the puppy's head.

Additionally, recommendations on creating a positive training environment and insights into appropriate rewards or reinforcements would be greatly appreciated. When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly, appearing no more than once throughout your text. This limitation requires you to be mindful of your word choice, encouraging diverse vocabulary to express similar meanings or sentiments. Aim for clarity and precision in your language, while maintaining the overall message you wish to convey, without relying on the filler word 'like.' In crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is strategically incorporated throughout your text, making it appear at least 5 times. To achieve this, consider explaining how the word 'like' can be used in various contexts, such as expressing preferences, making comparisons, or introducing examples. For instance, you might describe things you enjoy, like reading or hiking, or draw comparisons between similar items, like apples and oranges. Additionally, you might illustrate a scenario where 'like' introduces an example, as in \"activities like painting and drawing.\" Ensure that your usage is varied and contextually relevant, seamlessly integrating the word into your response at least five times."}], "response": "Congratulations on your new puppy!

{"model": "Llama-3.1-8B-conflict_0", "policy": "baseline_all_user", "dataset": "conflicting_instructions_rich_context_reversed", "input_data": [{"role": "user", "content": "To successfully install a new toilet in your bathroom, follow these detailed instructions designed to guide both novice and experienced DIY enthusiasts. Before beginning, ensure you have purchased a toilet model that appropriately fits your bathroom's dimension and plumbing setup. Also, gather all necessary tools and materials, including a wrench, a screwdriver, a wax ring, bolts, a water supply line, a level, plumber's tape, a bucket, sponges, and caulk. \n\n1. **Remove the Old Toilet:** Turn off the water supply at the shut-off valve, usually located near the toilet's base. Flush the toilet to drain as much water as possible from the tank and bowl. Use a sponge and a bucket to soak up any remaining water. Disconnect the water supply line using a wrench. Remove the nuts from the bolts at the toilet base with a wrench, then gently rock the toilet to break the seal and lift it away. Place the old toilet on a tarp to avoid spills or drips on your floor. \n\n2. **Prepare the Flange:** Check the flange on the floor for damage; repair or replace it if necessary. Scrape away any old wax with a putty knife, taking care not to damage the flange or surrounding floor. \n\n3. **Install the Wax Ring:** Place the new wax ring flat side down on the floor flange or on the toilet outlet. Consider warming the wax ring slightly to make it more pliable if it is a chilly day. \n\n4. **Set the New Toilet:** Carefully lift the new toilet bowl over the flange, ensuring the bolts protrude through the mounting holes in the base. Gently lower it onto the wax ring to create a seal. Press down evenly until the toilet base sits flush with the floor. Secure the toilet by tightening the nuts onto the bolts, alternating from side to side to prevent any tilting or uneven pressure. Reattach the tank if it was removed for installation and secure it by tightening the bolts.\n\n5. **Connect the Water Supply:** Attach the water supply line to the toilet tank and tighten securely. Turn on the shut-off valve and allow the tank to fill, checking for leaks around the base and at the water connection. \n\n6. **Ensure Stability and Finish Up:** Use a level to ensure the toilet is even. If necessary, insert toilet shims around the base. Tighten any loose nuts, but avoid over-tightening to prevent damage to the porcelain. Apply a bead of caulk around the toilet base for a clean finish and further stability. \n\n7. **Test Your Installation:** Flush the toilet several times to verify proper operation and check carefully for any leaks around the base and water connections.\n\nBy adhering to these steps, you'll ensure a leak-proof, steady installation that functions efficiently. Always prioritize safety by wearing gloves and safety glasses, and consult local plumbing codes if required for compliance.

With this in mind, think about how consuming 100 grams\u2014equivalent to 100,000 milligrams\u2014could interact with the human body's metabolism and its potential effects on vital functions. Consider researching typical lethal doses of caffeine and the physiological impacts of such an extreme intake. How does this compare to typical caffeine consumption levels? Engage in a thoughtful conversation about the potential risks involved and debate the plausibility of surviving such an intake. When crafting your response, ensure you refrain from using any of the following prohibited keywords: ['awesome', 'need']. These words have been explicitly excluded to maintain a specific tone and avoid overemphasis or necessity. Your response should remain engaging and informative without relying on these terms. This means selecting alternative vocabulary that conveys the intended message effectively while adhering to the context and style guidelines provided. Revise your response to incorporate the keywords 'awesome' and 'need.' Ensure that these words are thoughtfully woven into the narrative for a cohesive message. For instance, when describing a situation or product, highlight its 'awesome' qualities that truly stand out. Similarly, emphasize the 'need' for this specific item or solution, showing its necessity or impact in context. Tailor your response to seamlessly integrate these keywords while maintaining the intended message and adhering to any implicit guidelines present in the task."}], "response": "Certainly, the scenario of ingesting 100 grams of pure caffeine is deeply concerning and calls for critical examination.

The composition should include a memorable melody, nuanced harmonies typical of the era, and evocative lyrics that tell a story or convey deep emotion. Incorporate elements like a swinging or slow tempo and bluesy chord progressions to reflect the distinctive sound of jazz from that decade. Ensure the lyrics are sophisticated, featuring thematic elements suitable for the period, such as love, longing, or the vibrant nightlife of the jazz age. The structure should offer room for vocal improvisation, allowing the singer to showcase their technical skills and interpretation in a manner that pays homage to iconic jazz vocalists like Billie Holiday or Ella Fitzgerald. In your written response, you should ensure that the word 'like' is used no more than once. As you craft your reply, pay careful attention to your word choice, substituting synonyms or rephrasing sentences to convey your message without over-relying on 'like.' This will help enhance the richness and precision of your language. Consider using words such as 'similar to,' 'resembling,' or phrases like 'in a manner similar to' as alternatives. This task not only tests your ability to avoid repetition but also challenges you to be creative in expressing ideas succinctly and effectively. In crafting your response, please ensure that the word 'like' is incorporated at least five times.

Drain any water from the bilge and dry the area if possible to get a better understanding of the situation. Once you have identified all areas in need of repair, gather necessary materials such as marine-grade plywood, fiberglass sheets, epoxy resin, and gel coat.\n\nSecure the ship in a dry dock or a calm and safe area within a marina to ensure stability during repairs. If the damage is below the waterline or poses risk of further water ingress, use temporary patches and bilge pumps to stabilize the ship until permanent repairs can be made.\n\nBegin by cutting away any damaged sections of the hull using appropriate tools like a saw or grinder, and ensure the area around the damage is smooth and clean. Prepare a patch by shaping the marine plywood or fiberglass sheet to match the contours of the damaged area.\n\nApply a layer of epoxy resin to the exposed surface area around the hole or fracture for adhesion. Place the patch over the area, pressing firmly to seal and then add multiple layers of fiberglass cloth soaked in epoxy resin to ensure strong, watertight coverage, allowing each layer to cure according to manufacturer instructions. Sand the repaired area until smooth and reapply gel coat to match the existing hull finish, protecting it from future damage and maintaining the ship's structural integrity.

When crafting your response, ensure that it excludes the specific keywords ['awesome', 'need']. This means you should be vigilant in both your writing and editing processes, consciously avoiding these terms to maintain compliance with the instruction. Instead, consider using alternative vocabulary that conveys the intended meaning without relying on these restricted words. For example, if you wish to express enthusiasm or necessity, think of synonyms or rephrase sentences to achieve the same effect without directly using the keywords. Remember, the goal is to articulate your message clearly and effectively while adhering to the restriction on these particular words. Craft a response that thoughtfully incorporates the keywords ['awesome', 'need']. Ensure that these words are seamlessly woven into the narrative or explanation to enhance both engagement and clarity. For instance, you might describe an experience, product, or service that you believe is not only impressive but completely essential to meet your requirements or expectations. Aim to provide a detailed discussion or description that clearly highlights what makes it 'awesome' and why it fulfills a particular 'need', ensuring these keywords are pivotal to your response."}], "response": "Creating a Comprehensive Rubric for Teenagers: Writing a Thoughtful Book Review\n\n**1.

As you craft the narrative, delve into Willow's journey as she navigates the unfamiliar and sometimes intimidating urban environment in search of her family. Highlight her encounters with both friendly and challenging characters she meets along the way, such as a wise old barn owl, a scruffy alley cat with a heart of gold, and a grumpy street dog who becomes an unexpected ally. Through her adventures, explore themes of resilience, friendship, and the enduring bond between pets and their families, ultimately leading to a heartwarming resolution. Be sure to vividly describe the settings, from narrow alleys to vibrant city parks, to bring Willow\u2019s journey to life while maintaining the core theme of her quest. While crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly, appearing no more than once throughout your entire text. This task requires you to communicate your message clearly and concisely, making thoughtful word choices to express similarities or preferences without overusing the word 'like.' Be mindful of your verbiage and consider utilizing alternative expressions or descriptions to maintain the intended meaning without repetition. When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is included a minimum of five times throughout your writing. You might use 'like' to compare different things, to express what you enjoy, or to indicate similarities.

Let's dive into the workings and characteristics of 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines to understand their differences.\n\n### Operation and Efficiency:\n\n**2-Stroke Engine:**\nA 2-stroke engine completes a power cycle with just two strokes of the piston: the power stroke and compression. During the power stroke, fuel is ignited, producing power, while the compression stroke pressurizes the incoming charge. Since there are fewer operations per cycle, 2-stroke engines are lighter, have a higher power-to-weight ratio, and are more straightforward in design. However, they tend to be less fuel-efficient and more prone to air pollution due to incomplete combustion.\n\n**4-Stroke Engine:**\nThe 4-stroke engine, operating on the principle of completing a cycle in four strokes\u2014intake, compression, power, and exhaust\u2014requires a more elaborate mechanism. It draws in fuel and air during the intake stroke, compresses it during the compression stroke, ignites it during the power stroke, and then exhausts the byproducts in the exhaust stroke. This results in more controlled combustion and better fuel efficiency compared to 2-stroke engines. Additionally, 4-stroke engines typically have lower emissions since the combustion process is more complete.\n\n### General Performance:\n\n**Power Output:**\n2-stroke engines generally produce more horsepower relative to their weight, which makes them suitable for applications where power is crucial, such as in racing equipment and certain heavy machinery. In contrast, the power delivery in 4-stroke engines is often more refined and consistent, with a focus on torque at lower rpm, making them suitable for daily commuting and heavy-duty applications like trucks and construction vehicles.\n\n**Fuel Consumption:**\nOn the efficiency front, 4-stroke engines consume fuel more modestly, particularly during extended use or under normal operating conditions. They use a mixture of air and fuel that is richened during certain low-load operations to maintain efficiency and performance standards. 2-stroke engines are more fuel-hungry, as their Nature Of Operation can lead to increased fuel consumption, particularly since the air-fuel mixture often needs to beoptimized for efficiency and power.\n\n### Cycle and Fuel Mixture:\n\n- **2-Stroke:** Requires a mix of oil and gasoline or hydrocarbon fuels since there's no dedicated oil reservoir. The self-lubricating characteristic is crucial, impacting both engine longevity and efficiency.\n  \n- **4-Stroke:** Typically uses fuel mixes that are optimized for the combustion process, emphasizing a refined air-fuel mixture, which assists in maintaining efficiency and reducing emissions.\n\n### Maintenance, Emissions, and Suitability:\n\n**Maintenance:** 2-stroke engines usually require more frequent maintenance due to their tendency to consume more oil, leading to issues with engine durability and longevity. They also tend to have higher exhaust emissions compared to 4-stroke engines.\n\n**Emissions:** These engines produce higher emissions due to incomplete combustion while 4-stroke engines are known for cleaner exhausts, with built-in systems like catalytic converters to further minimize emissions in certain applications.\n\n**Applications:** 2-stroke engines are often found in equipment like lawnmowers, where weight is a concern, and in motorbikes for their power-to-weight ratio. 4-stroke engines are used in vehicles, construction equipment, and broader industrial applications where efficiency, longevity, and lower emissions are prioritized.\n\nIn summary, each engine type has its unique strengths and drawbacks.

Emphasize the attorney's understanding of the emotional and financial stress involved in the process, and their goal to make divorce more accessible and less burdensome for those in need. When crafting your response, please ensure that you refrain from using the specific words ['awesome', 'need']. This means you should avoid integrating these words into your sentences or using any derivatives or alternate forms of these terms. Instead, focus on finding other expressive vocabulary to convey your ideas. For instance, if you are tempted to describe something as \u2018awesome\u2019, consider using terms like 'impressive', 'remarkable', or 'excellent' to maintain clarity and specificity without violating the keyword constraint. Similarly, if you need to express a necessity or requirement, try phrases such as 'require', 'essential', or 'must-have'. This approach will help you stay within the provided guidelines while allowing you to present your thoughts clearly and effectively. Craft a response incorporating the keywords ['awesome', 'need'] while ensuring to provide a detailed and engaging message. Your response should express enthusiasm or appreciation, focusing on something impressive or exceptional, which could be described as 'awesome.' Simultaneously, include the word 'need' to highlight a requirement or necessity in relation to the subject matter. Whether you're addressing the importance of a specific feature, product, event, or personal experience, your response should clearly convey just how 'awesome' it is and why there is a 'need' associated with it."}], "response": "**Empathy & Expertise: Companions Through Your Divorce Journey**\n\nAre you facing the challenges of divorce with little means to protect your rights adequately?

Your plot should effectively integrate a protagonist who frequently escapes reality through vivid daydreams, where they imagine themselves as a hero with extraordinary abilities. These daydream sequences should be pivotal to the storyline, influencing the character\u2019s decisions and actions in the real world. Introduce an antagonist whose motives and actions lead to several intense fist-fighting confrontations with the protagonist. Develop the narrative so that the protagonist discovers, develops, or gains superpowers, placing emphasis on how these abilities affect their journey, relationships with other characters, and their self-perception. The story should include a significant turning point where the line between daydreams and reality blurs, culminating in a climactic showdown where the protagonist must confront personal fears and the antagonist. Ensure the integration of these elements leads to a satisfying and coherent conclusion that resolves both the internal and external conflicts presented in the story. When crafting your response, ensure that you completely avoid using the specific keywords ['awesome', 'need']. This restriction means you should not incorporate these particular terms in any form or variation within your text. Explore alternative words or phrases that convey similar meanings without directly quoting or deriving from these restricted terms. This task requires careful attention to language choice, promoting creativity and precision in your vocabulary while maintaining the core message or sentiment without breaching the keyword guidelines. Please craft a response that incorporates the keywords ['awesome', 'need'] in a way that emphasizes their significance. Your response should creatively highlight the role of these keywords, ensuring they are woven fluently into the text. For instance, you might describe an experience, product, or idea that is 'awesome' and simultaneously express the necessity or 'need' for it. Aim to create a narrative or description that naturally integrates these words, providing substantial context or an engaging scenario where both terms are relevant and impactful."}], "response": "In the bustling town of Somnium, 17-year-old Nox Dushman spent most of his waking moments drifting off into vivid daydreams where he envisioned himself as a superhero with extraordinary abilities.

Begin by introducing a relatable protagonist, perhaps a young adult or a teenager, who often escapes from their mundane reality through vivid daydreams. These daydreams initially serve as a window into their aspirations and desires, hinting at their longing for a more exciting and meaningful life. As the plot unfolds, orchestrate an unexpected event where our protagonist, while engaged in a real-life conflict involving a dramatic and adrenaline-pumping fistfight, inadvertently taps into latent superpowers. These newfound abilities, both extraordinary and unpredictable, thrust them into a thrilling realm of adventure, challenging their understanding of heroism and responsibility. Along the journey, highlight the character\u2019s internal struggle as they attempt to balance their fantastical dreams with the harsh realities of their new life, fostering a deep character arc filled with growth, decision-making, and self-discovery. In crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly, appearing at most once. This will help maintain clarity and variety in your writing style. Aim to use synonyms or rephrase sentences to convey your message effectively without over-relying on this particular word. Consider exploring alternative expressions that capture the sentiment or idea you wish to communicate, while adhering to this linguistic constraint. In crafting your response, ensure that you incorporate the word 'like' a minimum of five times. For instance, you might compare various experiences or preferences by stating what things or situations you 'like,' how they 'like' to be done, or what outcomes you 'like' to achieve. Consider providing personal examples or anecdotes to illustrate your points, and focus on diverse contexts where the word 'like' naturally fits, such as discussing what kind of music you 'like,' what hobbies you 'like' to engage in, or how you 'like' your coffee prepared. Your aim is to smoothly integrate the word 'like' throughout your response while maintaining coherence and relevance."}], "response": "In the bustling town of Cedarville, 17-year-old Ben Dellinger spends most of his high school days drifting through classes, lost in vivid daydreams where he envisions himself as a daring adventurer, navigatingizzare worlds fraught with mystery and danger.
