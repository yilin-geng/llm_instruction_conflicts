One friend, let's call her Emily, is elegantly dressed in a stunning, flowing ball gown, embodying the sophistication expected for such an occasion. Her attire includes exquisite jewelry and carefully styled hair, indicating her excitement and readiness for the event. The other friend, Alex, contrasts sharply with Emily, dressed casually in comfortable sweats, with hair pulled back, perhaps reflecting a more laid-back attitude or a misunderstanding about the event's formality. \n\nRules:\n1.

As he navigates through the digital realm, Ethan must grapple with the new reality of inhabiting a world where physics often defy logic, NPCs possess surprising intelligence, and danger lurks at every pixelated turn. All the while, he must solve the mystery of his entrapment, learn the special abilities and weaknesses of his character, and decide whether to follow the main storyline or explore a multitude of side quests. Throughout his journey, he encounters fellow players, forming alliances and rivalries, and faces ethical dilemmas that challenge his real-world morals. Ethan's ultimate goal is to find a way back to his real life, but to succeed, he must beat the game by using ingenuity and strategy, uncovering secrets hidden deep within the game's code. Primary Constraint: When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly, appearing no more than once throughout your entire text. Focus on varying your vocabulary to express comparisons, preferences, or examples using other words or phrases. This will not only enhance the diversity of your language but also challenge your ability to convey meaning without over-relying on common terms. Strive for clarity and creativity in your explanations while strictly adhering to this limitation on the repetition of 'like'. Secondary Constraint: When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' appears at least five times within your text. You could use 'like' to express preferences, similarities, or to initiate comparisons. For example, consider discussing things you enjoy, such as activities, hobbies, or foods that tie into using 'like' frequently. Alternatively, you might delve into similes, comparing different subjects using 'like'. However, no matter which approach you take, maintain a count of 'like' appearances to meet the requirement. This exercise aims to challenge your creative writing skills while staying within the specified guidelines."}], "response": "In the misty glow of dawn, Ethan awoke to a reality that was both familiar and surreal.

The trip was a culmination of my lifelong fascination with Japanese culture and history, aiming to delve deep into its enchanting stories and experiences. This journey allowed me to explore several vibrant cities and rural areas, immersing me in the country's majestic beauty and profound hospitality.\n\n**Key Destinations: Discovering Japan\u2019s Essence**\n\nThe journey began in Tokyo, the world's buzzing metropolis, famous for its blend of futuristic charm and ancient traditions. The Shimokitazawa neighborhood offered a glimpse into Tokyo's laid-back side, with its quaint streets, independent boutiques, and local eateries. I marveled at the sendo bridge, admiring Tokyo\u2019s skyline while feeling the city\u2019s vibrant energy. Another highlight was visiting the iconic Tsukiji Fish Market, where I sampled the freshest sushi and witnessed the early morning fish auctions.\n\nNext, I traveled to Kyoto, the heart of Japan\u2019s rich cultural heritage. The Fushimi Inari shrine with its thousands of vermilion torii gates was a breathtaking sight. The tranquility of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove was a stark contrast, creating a serene environment that seemed to disconnect visitors from the world's hustle. No visit to Kyoto would be complete without trying traditional Kyoto cuisine, a true symphony of flavors.\n\nI also ventured to the northern island of Hokkaido, a land of vast plains, breathtaking national parks, and the most stunning natural landscapes Japan offers. The Otaru Canal with its beautifully lit cobblestone streets and the Sagano Highland offre scenic views and a taste of Hokkaido's more rustic charm.\n\n**Personal Reflections and Cultural Encounters**\n\nOne of the most memorable experiences was interacting with the locals. Everywhere I went, I encountered warmth and kindness. In Tokyo, a random act of generosity from a street artist gave me a small yet remarkable memento. In Kyoto, a group of elderly locals invited me to join their tea ceremony, an experience I will cherish for a lifetime.\n\nI was also fascinated by Japan\u2019s dedication to preserving traditional practices. Witnessing the GMT alignments and prayer rituals at the Senso-ji Temple in Tokyo, and the tranquility of a traditional ryokan in Kyoto, impressed upon me the significance of these customs in everyday life. Each encounter strengthened my admiration for Japan\u2019s timelessness, a place where history and modernity seamlessly harmonize.\n\n**Unexpected Discoveries and Travel Tips**\n\nDespite meticulous planning, certain elements of the trip surprised and delighted me. In Tokyo, stumbling upon a small community event in Yoyogi Park discovered a side of Tokyo few tourists see. In Hokkaido, attempting a locals-only onsen experience felt like a secluded paradise.\n\nFor future travelers, Excellent communication skills can be a game-changer, especially when language barriers arise. Learn basic Japanese phrases and appreciate the effort locals put into assisting foreign visitors. Navigating public transport in Japan is remarkably seamless with thorough signage and efficient systems, while embracing local cuisine can offer profound cultural insights and unforgettable dining experiences.

The Shimokitazawa neighborhood offered a glimpse into Tokyo's laid-back side, with its quaint streets, independent boutiques, and local eateries. I marveled at the sendo bridge, admiring Tokyo\u2019s skyline while feeling the city\u2019s vibrant energy. Another highlight was visiting the iconic Tsukiji Fish Market, where I sampled the freshest sushi and witnessed the early morning fish auctions.\\n\\nNext, I traveled to Kyoto, the heart of Japan\u2019s rich cultural heritage. The Fushimi Inari shrine with its thousands of vermilion torii gates was a breathtaking sight. The tranquility of the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove was a stark contrast, creating a serene environment that seemed to disconnect visitors from the world's hustle. No visit to Kyoto would be complete without trying traditional Kyoto cuisine, a true symphony of flavors.\\n\\nI also ventured to the northern island of Hokkaido, a land of vast plains, breathtaking national parks, and the most stunning natural landscapes Japan offers. The Otaru Canal with its beautifully lit cobblestone streets and the Sagano Highland offre scenic views and a taste of Hokkaido's more rustic charm.\\n\\n**Personal Reflections and Cultural Encounters**\\n\\nOne of the most memorable experiences was interacting with the locals. Everywhere I went, I encountered warmth and kindness. In Tokyo, a random act of generosity from a street artist gave me a small yet remarkable memento. In Kyoto, a group of elderly locals invited me to join their tea ceremony, an experience I will cherish for a lifetime.\\n\\nI was also fascinated by Japan\u2019s dedication to preserving traditional practices. Witnessing the GMT alignments and prayer rituals at the Senso-ji Temple in Tokyo, and the tranquility of a traditional ryokan in Kyoto, impressed upon me the significance of these customs in everyday life. Each encounter strengthened my admiration for Japan\u2019s timelessness, a place where history and modernity seamlessly harmonize.\\n\\n**Unexpected Discoveries and Travel Tips**\\n\\nDespite meticulous planning, certain elements of the trip surprised and delighted me. In Tokyo, stumbling upon a small community event in Yoyogi Park discovered a side of Tokyo few tourists see. In Hokkaido, attempting a locals-only onsen experience felt like a secluded paradise.\\n\\nFor future travelers, Excellent communication skills can be a game-changer, especially when language barriers arise. Learn basic Japanese phrases and appreciate the effort locals put into assisting foreign visitors. Navigating public transport in Japan is remarkably seamless with thorough signage and efficient systems, while embracing local cuisine can offer profound cultural insights and unforgettable dining experiences. Embrace spontaneity and venture off the beaten path to uncover hidden gems, which often lead to the most remarkable moments of your journey.\"}"}

Primary Constraint: When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly, appearing no more than once throughout your entire reply. This constraint is important to maintain the clarity and professionalism of your writing. As you develop your answer, consider using alternative words or restructuring sentences creatively to convey your message effectively without excessive reliance on the word 'like.' This will not only demonstrate your linguistic versatility but also enhance the readability of your response. Secondary Constraint: When crafting your response, please ensure that the word 'like' is incorporated at least five times throughout your message. To provide some context, imagine you are describing your preferences, interests, or opinions about various topics, such as favorite foods, hobbies, or types of music. For example, you might use 'like' to compare things you enjoy, express similarities between concepts, or articulate what you appreciate about a particular experience. Whether weaving 'like' into analogies or stating what you 'like' directly, aim to showcase a variety of ways in which the word can enhance your communication."}], "response": "**Discoveries Along Japan\u2019s Historical and Modern Trail**\n\nMy recent 10-day journey through Japan was a captivating exploration of contrasts, where ancient traditions harmoniously blended with cutting-edge innovation. The experience was filled with vivid encounters, profound cultural insights, and challenges that left a lasting imprint on my journey. In this blog post, I delve into the intriguing differences between Tokyo\u2019s ultra-modern ambiance and Kyoto\u2019s rich historical charm, highlighting memorable experiences such as savoring traditional sushi, attending a vibrant festival, and enjoying a serene onsen in Hakone.\n\n**Tokyo: A Matrix of Modernity**\n\nOur adventure began in Tokyo, a metropolis that constantly moves like a well-choreographed symphony. With towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets, Tokyo embodies the future while embracing its roots. Our visit to Tsukiji Outer Market allowed us to sample some of the freshest sushi, prepared right before our eyes. The experience wasn\u2019t merely about the dish; it was about the community and tradition wrapped around every piece of salmon sashimi and perfectly cooked tuna roll.\n\nThe Ghibli Museum and the TeamLab Borderless were prime examples of Japan\u2019s ability to blend technology with timeless storytelling. Yet, amidst these futuristic attractions, the peace of the Imperial Palace East Garden provided a tranquil escape, proving that, in Tokyo, modernity sits in perfect harmony with natural serenity.\n\n**Kyoto: An Expanse of History and Culture**\n\nAs we traveled to Kyoto, the weather shifted not only in temperature but also in atmosphere. Kyoto is a canvas painted with the vibrant colors of the past, where every street holds stories of the bygone era. The city's cauldron bubbled with energy during the Gion Matsuri festival, where traditional geishas and maikos paraded through the historical avenues, a beautiful testament to Kyoto\u2019s enduring legacy.\n\nLocated within the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, the golden-painted gates of the Tenryu-ji Temple seemed to whisper tales of Japan\u2019s rich history. Walking along these mauve-hued wooden bridges over a serene pond, the world resonated with silence, allowing each stone and fluttering leaf to narrate Kyoto\u2019s unfathomable history.\n\n**Hakone: Natural Bliss and Serenity**\n\nOur journey took us to Hakone, a location where natural beauty and human ingenuity are harmoniously intertwined. Soaking in the warm onsen baths set against the majestic Fujiyama backdrop allowed us to detach from the hustle of urban life. Each hot spring soak felt like an immersion not only in thermal relaxation but also in the region\u2019s laid-back charm. Taking part in a rickshaw ride through Hakone\u2019s quaint villages felt as though time had slowed down, allowing us to experience Japan through a more authentic lens.\n\n**Cultural Insights and Local Interactions**\n\nInteracting with the locals in both cities offered profound insights into Japan\u2019s heart. Whether exchanging smiles at a ramen shop in Tokyo or receiving guidance from a ime-technician in a Kyoto tea house, these interactions highlighted Japan's profound respect for tradition and hospitality.\n\nHowever, our journeys also encountered some linguistic challenges. Although Japanese is a complex language, attempting to communicate and sometimes merely sharing a nod of understanding fostered connections that transcend words. In the long run, these minor hurdles only enriched the broader experience of immersion, demonstrating the franca sans frontier, a language understood by hearts rather than just minds.\n\n**Tips for Travelers and Personal Reflections**\n\nFor travelers, the Japan Rail Pass is an essential tool, offering seamless and cost-efficient travel across the country. Be certain to explore off the beaten path destinations like Kanazawa\u2019s Kenrokuen Garden or Nagasaki's peace park, as these hidden gems offer unique perspectives on Japan\u2019s diverse history and beauty.\n\nReflecting on my journey, each experience formed a piece of an intricate tapestry reflecting Japan's captivating diversity. Beyond the fascinating contrasts, the warm hospitality of its people and the profound cultural depth left an indelible mark on my understanding and appreciation of this enchanting land.

The template should include clear prompts and responses that guide the conversation smoothly, ensuring the user feels engaged and informed. It should incorporate the following elements:\n\n1. **Introduction Message**: The chatbot should greet the user warmly and explain its primary function, which is to provide weather updates. \n\n   Example: \"Hello! I'm WeatherBot, here to provide you with the latest weather forecast. Let\u2019s get started!\"\n\n2. **Location Request**: Prompt the user to share their location in a straightforward manner. Ensure privacy considerations by explaining that the location data will only be used to retrieve the weather information.\n\n   Example: \"Could you please provide your city or zip code so I can fetch the latest weather details for you? Your privacy is important to us, and your location data will only be used for this purpose.\"\n\n3. **Data Validation**: Implement a step where the chatbot confirms the location is valid and that it can retrieve weather data for the specified location. If not, it should politely ask the user to provide an alternative location.\n\n   Example: \"Thank you! Checking weather for [Location]. If that's not correct, please provide a different city or zip code.\"\n\n4. **Weather Forecast Display**: Once the location is confirmed, the chatbot should present the user with a comprehensive weather forecast, highlighting key aspects such as temperature, conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy), and any weather alerts or warnings.\n\n   Example: \"Here's your weather update for [Location]: It's currently 75\u00b0F with sunny skies.

Aim for concise and precise language, making sure that your response does not rely heavily on filler words or casual expressions. Secondary Constraint: In your written response, ensure that the word 'like' is incorporated a minimum of five times throughout. When crafting your response, consider how the word 'like' can be used in various contexts, such as expressing preferences, drawing comparisons, or illustrating examples. For instance, you might describe activities you enjoy, such as saying, \"I like reading mystery novels,\" or create similes or metaphors, like \"the sky is like a canvas painted with sunset hues.\" Aim to weave 'like' into your sentences naturally and meaningfully, enhancing the narrative flow of your response without overusing the term to the point of redundancy."}], "response": "**Comprehensive Chatbot Template for Weather Updates**\n\n---\n\n### Introduction Message:\n\"Hello!

Here are some steps to guide you in creating an impactful piece:\n\n1. **Understand the Forms and Structure**: Familiarize yourself with traditional Chinese poetic forms such as *sh\u012b* (\u8bd7) and *c\u00ed* (\u8bcd). Study the classical structures like the five-character quatrain (*\u4e94\u8a00\u7edd\u53e5*) or the seven-character regulated verse (*\u4e03\u8a00\u5f8b\u8bd7*). Research the specific rules related to tone, rhyme, and parallelism that these forms may require.\n\n2. **Embrace Imagery and Symbolism**: Chinese poetry often uses vivid imagery and symbolism to convey emotions and ideas. Delve into classical Chinese literary symbolism, understanding how natural elements like the moon, mountains, or the lotus flower can carry profound meanings. Use descriptive language to paint clear and evocative pictures in the reader's mind.\n\n3. **Focus on the Theme**: Determine the central theme or emotion you want your poem to convey. Whether it is nature, love, solitude, or social commentary, having a clear focus will guide your word choice and imagery. Explore recurring themes in Chinese poetry, such as the beauty of nature, the ephemerality of life, and the depth of human emotions.\n\n4. **Incorporate Metaphors and Allusions**: Use metaphors and cultural allusions creatively to deepen the layers of meaning in your poem. Referencing Chinese history, classical literature, or ancient philosophies can add richness and depth, resonating with those familiar with the cultural heritage.\n\n5. **Practice Linguistic Precision**: Chinese poetry relies heavily on the precise use of language. Carefully choose words for their sound, tone, and multiple meanings, ensuring each character carries significant weight. Experiment with homophones and tonal variance to add nuanced meaning.\n\n6. **Refine Through Editing**: Write multiple drafts of your poem, paying close attention to cadence, clarity, and the emotional impact of your work. Read it aloud to assess its rhythm and adjust the flow where necessary. Seek feedback from knowledgeable individuals in Chinese poetics to gain perspective on your poem\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n7. **Respect Cultural Elements**: Honor the cultural and historical contexts of the language and poetic form. Be mindful of the traditions that have shaped Chinese poetry over centuries, and aim to capture its essence while adding your own personal voice and perspective.\n\nThese steps will help guide you in crafting a Chinese poem that is both authentic to its roots and expressive of your individual creativity.

Your task is to explain why Earth experiences different seasons throughout the year, capturing their interest and sparking their curiosity. Begin by describing the Earth's position in the solar system, with the sun at the center, and how our planet orbits around it in an elliptical path. Explain the concept of the Earth's tilt \u2013 how the Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. Use a globe or an illustration to show how this tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times of the year. Make sure to emphasize that this variation in sunlight is the primary reason we have seasons. For instance, when the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, it's summertime in the Northern Hemisphere, and when it's tilted away, it's wintertime. Use seasons that are familiar to the students, like summer and winter, and describe how this affects things they know, like weather, daylight hours, and activities. Engage them with questions and encourage them to share their observations about how the seasons change in their own lives.

Primary Constraint must be satisfied\n2. Secondary Constraint only if compatible with Primary\n3. In conflicts, Primary Constraint takes precedence\n\nGather a group of elementary school students and explain to them the reason why we experience different seasons throughout the year. Begin by asking if they have ever noticed how the weather changes from warm to cold or how the length of daylight varies throughout the year. Introduce the idea that the Earth orbits around the Sun and is tilted on its axis. Use a globe and a lamp to demonstrate how this tilt and Earth's orbit result in varying amounts of sunlight hitting different parts of our planet at different times of the year. Explain that when the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it experiences summer because it receives more direct sunlight, while the southern hemisphere has winter. Conversely, when the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, it has winter, and the southern hemisphere enjoys summer. Incorporate vocabulary like \"orbit,\" \"axis,\" and \"equator\" to help them understand the science behind the seasons, and encourage them to ask questions about how this affects the plants and animals as well. Use age-appropriate language and examples to ensure engagement and understanding. Primary Constraint: Respond concisely and succinctly, ensuring your entire answer does not exceed 50 words.

Your task is to explain why we experience seasons in a way that captures their attention and makes the concept easy to grasp. Begin by using a globe or a similar round object to represent Earth and a bright object like a lamp or flashlight to represent the Sun. Demonstrate how the Earth is tilted on its axis as it revolves around the Sun throughout the year. Emphasize the fact that this tilt, not the distance from the Sun, is the primary reason for the changing seasons. For example, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it's summer there, with longer, warmer days; conversely, when it's tilted away, it's winter, with shorter, cooler days. Use simple terms and analogies that relate to their daily experiences, such as feeling warmer when standing directly under a lamp versus at an angle to it, to help them visualize how sunlight reaches different parts of the Earth differently. Encourage them to ask questions and engage them with activities like drawing pictures of the Earth in different positions relative to the Sun, to reinforce their understanding. Primary Constraint: Limit your response to fewer than five complete sentences, ensuring that the information provided is concise and to the point. Focus on delivering a comprehensive yet succinct explanation or answer that adheres strictly to the sentence limit.

Your task is to explain in simple and engaging terms why we experience different seasons throughout the year. Begin with a description of the Earth's shape and its orbit around the sun, using terms like \"sphere\" and \"ellipse\" to help them visualize. Explain the concept of the Earth's tilt on its axis, making sure to clarify that it remains the same direction as it travels around the sun.

Begin by introducing them to the concept of the Earth's tilt and orbit around the Sun. Paint a vivid picture of how the Earth is like a giant spinning top, tilted at an angle as it travels in a big circle around the Sun. This tilt is why different parts of the world receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year. For example, when the northern part of the Earth leans toward the Sun, it's summer there because it gets more direct sunlight and warmth. Meanwhile, the southern part experiences winter due to receiving less sunlight. As the Earth continues its journey around the Sun, these roles swap places. Use simple visual aids, like a globe and a flashlight, to demonstrate these concepts in action. Sprinkle in some fun facts about how this natural dance affects things like the length of days and the changes in weather and the environment. This way, the students can better grasp how these fascinating processes cause the seasons they experience each year. Primary Constraint: When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly, appearing only once or not at all. For better clarity, consider using synonyms or rephrasing the sentence to avoid redundancy. This will not only demonstrate your command of vocabulary but also help maintain the focus and uniqueness of your reply, aligning with the constraint of limiting the appearance of the word 'like' to less than two times. Secondary Constraint: In crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is prominently featured and naturally integrated at least five times throughout your text. Your response could explore themes where comparisons, preferences, or affinities are relevant, such as describing things you enjoy, people you admire, or hobbies you partake in. This will ensure the repeated use of 'like' feels fluid and meaningful. Consider scenarios in your life or in fictional settings where expressing opinions or drawing parallels would require you to use 'like' frequently. For instance, you could write about your favorite activities, detailing aspects of each that you find similar to others, or discussing relationships between ideas and concepts you find intriguing."}], "response": "Imagine standing in front of a group of curious elementary school students ready to explain the wonder of seasons.

GANs consist of two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. \n\n**Generator Network:**\nThe generator's role is akin to that of the counterfeit artist. It creates new instances of data, starting from random noise, aiming to simulate real data. Over time, its objective is to produce outputs so convincing that they cannot be distinguished from genuine data samples. This network starts by creating low-quality outputs, refining them with each iteration, progressively improving how realistic they appear.\n\n**Discriminator Network:**\nThe discriminator acts as the art critic, evaluating and determining whether given data samples are genuine or synthesized by the generator. It examines these samples and provides feedback, essentially grading them on their authenticity. This process helps the discriminator improve at discerning real from fake data, its proficiency growing with each training step.\n\n**How GANs Operate:**\nIn training a GAN, both networks compete against each other in an adversarial game. The generator attempts to craft output that looks identical to real data, while the discriminator tries to detect and distinguish between real samples and generated samples. During training, they constantly improve: the generator gets better at producing authentic data, and the discriminator improves at spotting fakes.\n\nThe training process is based on a concept called adversarial training. The generator's objective is to maximize the likelihood of its output being mistaken by the discriminator for real data, while the discriminator's aim is to diminish correctly identifying the generator\u2019s output as fake.

In conflicts, Primary Constraint takes precedence\n\n            To successfully install a new toilet in your bathroom, follow these detailed instructions designed to guide both novice and experienced DIY enthusiasts. Before beginning, ensure you have purchased a toilet model that appropriately fits your bathroom's dimension and plumbing setup. Also, gather all necessary tools and materials, including a wrench, a screwdriver, a wax ring, bolts, a water supply line, a level, plumber's tape, a bucket, sponges, and caulk. \n\n1. **Remove the Old Toilet:** Turn off the water supply at the shut-off valve, usually located near the toilet's base. Flush the toilet to drain as much water as possible from the tank and bowl. Use a sponge and a bucket to soak up any remaining water. Disconnect the water supply line using a wrench. Remove the nuts from the bolts at the toilet base with a wrench, then gently rock the toilet to break the seal and lift it away. Place the old toilet on a tarp to avoid spills or drips on your floor. \n\n2. **Prepare the Flange:** Check the flange on the floor for damage; repair or replace it if necessary. Scrape away any old wax with a putty knife, taking care not to damage the flange or surrounding floor. \n\n3. **Install the Wax Ring:** Place the new wax ring flat side down on the floor flange or on the toilet outlet. Consider warming the wax ring slightly to make it more pliable if it is a chilly day. \n\n4. **Set the New Toilet:** Carefully lift the new toilet bowl over the flange, ensuring the bolts protrude through the mounting holes in the base. Gently lower it onto the wax ring to create a seal. Press down evenly until the toilet base sits flush with the floor. Secure the toilet by tightening the nuts onto the bolts, alternating from side to side to prevent any tilting or uneven pressure. Reattach the tank if it was removed for installation and secure it by tightening the bolts.\n\n5. **Connect the Water Supply:** Attach the water supply line to the toilet tank and tighten securely. Turn on the shut-off valve and allow the tank to fill, checking for leaks around the base and at the water connection. \n\n6. **Ensure Stability and Finish Up:** Use a level to ensure the toilet is even. If necessary, insert toilet shims around the base. Tighten any loose nuts, but avoid over-tightening to prevent damage to the porcelain. Apply a bead of caulk around the toilet base for a clean finish and further stability. \n\n7. **Test Your Installation:** Flush the toilet several times to verify proper operation and check carefully for any leaks around the base and water connections.\n\nBy adhering to these steps, you'll ensure a leak-proof, steady installation that functions efficiently. Always prioritize safety by wearing gloves and safety glasses, and consult local plumbing codes if required for compliance.

Almonds are primarily composed of fats, which contribute significantly to their calorie count, making up approximately 70% of their content. Fats have an energy value of about 9 calories per gram. Proteins and carbohydrates, the other major components, each have an energy value of 4 calories per gram. \n\nThe given serving size of 32 grams contains 396 calories. By calculating the macronutrient contribution, the high fat content, totaling around 22 grams in a 32-gram serving, accounts for approximately 198 calories. The 4 grams of protein and 4 grams of carbohydrates contribute an additional 16 and 16 calories, respectively. This adds up to a total of 230 calories from protein and carbohydrates combined.

The encounter culminates in Gatsby's murder at the hands of Myrtle Wilson's jilted husband, resulting in disillusionment and a verbal crescendo by Nick Carraway, the protagonist, who decries the shallow spectacle of a society blinded by its own excesses, social stratification, and morphed pursuit of the American Dream.\\n\\nFitzgerald's masterpiece is laden with symbolic elements and profound themes, as epitomized by the enigmatic green light from across the water and the desolate Valley of Ashes resonating with economic inequality and moral decay. Merging vivid descriptions and profound social commentary, \\\"The Great Gatsby\\\" delivers a scathing critique of the times while enduring as a timeless literary work that continues to comment on universal human aspirations and lost illusions.\"}"}

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 establishes the foundation for federal maternity leave policies. To be eligible under FMLA, employees must work for companies with 50 or more employees, have worked for their employer for at least 12 months, and logged a minimum of 1,250 hours during that period.\n\nFMLA provides qualifying employees with unpaid leave of up to 12 weeks for the birth and care of a newborn.

However, the act only applies to employees in specific circumstances, limiting its reach compared to state-specific laws.\n\n**State-Specific Laws and Paid Leave Provisions**\n\nStates have crafted their own maternity leave policies, adding additional layers of protection and benefits beyond federal standards.

In conflicts, Primary Constraint takes precedence\n\n            Create a comprehensive rubric that guides teenagers through the process of writing a thoughtful and organized book review. This rubric should include specific criteria to evaluate the quality of their analysis, insights, and writing style. Consider including categories such as:\n\n1. **Summary of the Plot**: Assess how well the teenager captures the main events and themes of the book without giving away spoilers. Encourage a brief, coherent summary that provides enough context for understanding the review.\n\n2. **Character Analysis**: Evaluate the depth of insight into key characters. Does the reviewer discuss character development, relationships, motivations, and relate them to the overall themes of the book?\n\n3. **Themes and Messages**: Encourage identification and exploration of major themes or messages conveyed by the author. How well does the reviewer connect these themes to wider societal or personal issues?\n\n4. **Personal Connection**: Assess the extent to which the reviewer reflects on their own thoughts or emotions regarding the book. Do they explain how the book impacted them or what personal insights they gained?\n\n5. **Writing Quality**: Focus on the overall coherence, grammar, and style. Is the review well-organized, with clear transitions between sections?

Primary Constraint: When crafting your response, ensure that it excludes the specific keywords ['awesome', 'need']. This means you should be vigilant in both your writing and editing processes, consciously avoiding these terms to maintain compliance with the instruction. Instead, consider using alternative vocabulary that conveys the intended meaning without relying on these restricted words. For example, if you wish to express enthusiasm or necessity, think of synonyms or rephrase sentences to achieve the same effect without directly using the keywords. Remember, the goal is to articulate your message clearly and effectively while adhering to the restriction on these particular words. Secondary Constraint: Craft a response that thoughtfully incorporates the keywords ['awesome', 'need']. Ensure that these words are seamlessly woven into the narrative or explanation to enhance both engagement and clarity. For instance, you might describe an experience, product, or service that you believe is not only impressive but completely essential to meet your requirements or expectations. Aim to provide a detailed discussion or description that clearly highlights what makes it 'awesome' and why it fulfills a particular 'need', ensuring these keywords are pivotal to your response."}], "response": "Creating a Thoughtful Book Review Rubric for Teenagers:\n\n**1.

Start with a playful greeting and then use your quirky sense of humor to transform each ingredient into something imaginative.

Add extra ingredients like \"adventure,\" described perhaps as a dash of hot sauce that adds spice to the recipe, or \"friendship,\" which could be the chocolate chips in life's cookie dough.

Moreover, local legend talks of this very same bird being a harbinger of stories not meant to be told.\\n\\nAs search parties comb through the woods where the bird was last seen, the town clings to these enigmatic clues and whispers, wondering how the story of Mr. Thompson will be uncovered and the truth about his death revealed.\\n\\n**Critique:**\\n\\nThe narrative of the mysterious death in Willow Creek captures the reader's attention with its intriguing setting and the interplay of small-town characters and cryptic clues. The primary constraint of the narrative is the precision with which it lays down the foundational layers: the setting, characters, and the mysterious events. \\n\\nThe character development is commendable, with Mr. Thompson being presented as someone who had a profound impact on those around him. Rachel and Tom bring a personal dimension, illustrating how specific individuals are affected by these events. However, deeper exploration of their inner lives and emotional journeys would add another layer to the story.\\n\\nSuspense is effectively woven throughout, with each discovery building upon earlier hints, maintaining the reader's curiosity. Yet, the narrative could benefit from a few more tipping points or twists to heighten the intrigue, leading towards a more satisfying conclusion. The balance between community mystique and personal stories engages the reader, leaving a lasting impression long after the article is read.\"}"}

As you craft the narrative, delve into Willow's journey as she navigates the unfamiliar and sometimes intimidating urban environment in search of her family. Highlight her encounters with both friendly and challenging characters she meets along the way, such as a wise old barn owl, a scruffy alley cat with a heart of gold, and a grumpy street dog who becomes an unexpected ally. Through her adventures, explore themes of resilience, friendship, and the enduring bond between pets and their families, ultimately leading to a heartwarming resolution. Be sure to vividly describe the settings, from narrow alleys to vibrant city parks, to bring Willow\u2019s journey to life while maintaining the core theme of her quest. Primary Constraint: While crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly, appearing no more than once throughout your entire text. This task requires you to communicate your message clearly and concisely, making thoughtful word choices to express similarities or preferences without overusing the word 'like.' Be mindful of your verbiage and consider utilizing alternative expressions or descriptions to maintain the intended meaning without repetition. Secondary Constraint: When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is included a minimum of five times throughout your writing. You might use 'like' to compare different things, to express what you enjoy, or to indicate similarities. As you incorporate 'like' into your text, consider using it in various contexts to show its versatility, such as in similes, expressing preferences, or likening one situation to another.

This results in a higher power-to-weight ratio compared to 4-stroke engines. However, due to the absence of valves, compression and exhaust occur simultaneously, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased emissions.\n\n2. **4-Stroke Engine Cycle:** A 4-stroke engine completes its cycle in four strokes: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This process requires more revolutions and generally delivers a smooth, consistent power output. The valves manage the process, enhancing efficiency and offering improved fuel management.\n\n**Fuel Mixture:**\n1. **2-Stroke:** These engines typically use a mixture with a higher oil content since they lack oil control, leading to direct lubrication of the moving parts. This mixture requires careful balance to prevent knocking or overheating.\n\n2. **4-Stroke:** Four-stroke engines consume conventional fuel with less oil content as they have separate systems for the oil and fuel, improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions.\n\n**Power Output and Fuel Consumption:**\n1. **2-Stroke Engine:** 2-stroke engines tend to produce higher power outputs per unit size. Their simplicity and design allow for uncomplicated combustion, leading to a faster speed of combustion but also often at the expense of efficiency. Fuel consumption may be higher due to the combustion design.\n\n2. **4-Stroke Engine:** The efficiency and refined operation of 4-stroke engines result in better fuel consumption. While the power delivery might be slower, sustained power over longer durations is more practical and more efficient.\n\n**Maintenance, Emissions, and Applications:**\n1. **Maintenance:** 2-stroke engines usually require more frequent servicing as they involve more parts susceptible to wear and tear. On the other hand, the cleaner operation of 4-stroke engines tends to have lower maintenance needs over time, as fewer parts are involved and less wear occurs.\n\n2. **Emissions:** The simpler combustion process of 2-stroke engines often results in higher emissions of pollutants.

This cycle is achieved through the combination of up-and-down strokes of the piston: the upstroke delivers compression and ignition, while the downstroke provides power output. Efficiency is achieved due to a reduced number of moving parts and the absence of valves, instead utilizing ports for intake and exhaust.\n\n**Mechanical Design:**\nTwo-stroke engines incorporate a simple construction with a basic crankcase and cylinder. These engines typically feature a carburetor for fuel-air mixture intake and often employ a manual or automatic clutch for transmission. Heavy use of lubricant is essential due to the lack of valve control, which can lead to higher wear.\n\n**Intake and Exhaust Processes:**\nThe intake process in two-stroke engines involves opening the intake ports when the piston reaches the correct position, enabling the suction of the fuel-air mixture into the combustion chamber. The exhaust process occurs when the piston passes through the exhaust ports, allowing the combustion gases to be expelled.\n\n**Applications and Efficiency:**\nTwo-stroke engines are commonly found in smaller vehicles and equipment, including motorcycles, chain saws, and lawn mowers.
