Highlight any relevant coursework or projects that may showcase skills or interests aligned with the desired job. Include a section for volunteer experience or any part-time work, such as babysitting or lawn care, which can demonstrate reliability and work ethic. Add a skills section where you list both hard and soft skills, such as proficiency in basic computer applications, effective communication, and teamwork. Finally, mention any references available upon request to give the prospective employer confidence in their application. Format the resume in a clear, professional manner that is easy to read and visually appealing. In crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is seamlessly incorporated at least five times throughout your writing. You might consider utilizing 'like' in various contexts such as to express preferences, draw comparisons, or describe feelings. For example, you could state what foods you like, discuss activities you enjoy, or compare situations by saying something is like another. Remember, the aim is to weave 'like' naturally into your response so that it enhances your narrative while meeting the requirement of its appearance at least five times."}], "response": "**[Name]**  \n[Address]  \n[City, State, ZIP]  \n[Phone Number]  \n[Email Address]\n\n---\n\n**Personal Summary**\n\nCharismatic and diligent recent high school graduate seeking to leverage my strong organizational skills and passion for learning to kickstart a fulfilling career.

it easier to write and maintain applications. for instance, it introduces features like null safety which eliminates null pointer exceptions, a common issue in java.\n\n2. **Interoperability**: kotlin is fully interoperable with java, which means developers can gradually introduce kotlin into their existing java projects without facing significant compatibility issues. classes and functions written in kotlin can easily be used within java projects and vice versa.\n\n3. **Concise Expressiveness**: many development tasks can be done more briefly and effectively in kotlin, yet without compromising clarity or readability. this results in higher productivity for developers who adapt to its syntax.\n\n4. **Modern Features**: kotlin includes modern features that have been developed keeping future growth and updates in mind, like coroutines for efficient asynchronous programming, which are not typically found in standard java libraries.\n\n5. **Better Null Handling**: it offers null safety which makes the code safer against null-related errors, a significant advantage when comparing to java\u2019s manual handling of nulls.\n\n6. **Extensions and Functionality**: kotlin's extension functions provide an elegant way to add new functionality to existing classes without needing to subclass them. this can lead to cleaner and more organized codebases.\n\n### kotlin disadvantages:\n\n1. **Steep Learning Curve**: while the syntax might appeal to some, there is a learning curve for those familiar only with java. the modern features and new concepts can be challenging to grasp initially.\n\n2. **Limited Resources**: although the kotlin community is active and continually expanding, it might not have the same level of established resources, tutorials, or libraries as java, which has a more extensive background and a longer presence in the development landscape.\n\n3. **Compile Time**: in some scenarios, compilation time may be longer when working exclusively with kotlin-based projects, which can affect the overall development speed at the initial stage.\n\n### java advantages:\n\n1. **Widespread Adoption**: java has been widely used in the android ecosystem for a longer period, resulting in a larger and more established community. it has numerous libraries, tutorials, and frameworks that developers can leverage.\n\n2. **Maturity and Stability**: the stability and maturity of java ensure that it is well-documented and has robust support for enterprise applications. many developers and companies rely heavily on its stability for mission-critical systems.\n\n3. **Easy Learning**: for those familiar with object-oriented programming concepts, java is generally easy to learn, offering a structure and syntax that many find intuitive.\n\n4. **Legacy Project Integration**: developers can seamlessly integrate and maintain older projects, as java has a long history, which means many projects are ji\u017e written in

Follow this with hands-on activities focused on setting up the Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. Introduce basic coding concepts like variables, data types, and control structures through simple, practical examples. Include a segment dedicated to understanding object-oriented programming principles such as classes and objects. Ensure to allocate time for participants to attempt coding exercises and receive feedback. The session should conclude with a Q&A segment, summarizing key takeaways and suggesting resources for further learning. In crafting your response, the word 'like' should be incorporated a minimum of five times to maintain consistency with the instruction. You might consider discussing a particular topic, such as your favorite hobbies, interests, or activities you enjoy, to naturally integrate the use of 'like.' For example, refer to things you appreciate, like your preferred music genres, like your favorite types of cuisine, and like the kinds of movies or TV shows you enjoy watching. This will help ensure your response flows naturally while effectively meeting the requirement for using the word 'like' at least five times."}], "response": "**Session Plan for Introductory Java Workshop:**\n\n### Objective:\nBy the end of this workshop, participants should be able to set up their development environment, understand basic Java concepts, and apply object-oriented programming principles.\n\n### Session Structure:\n\n#### **Session 1: Introduction to Java (20 minutes)**\n\n- **Objective:** Familiarize participants with Java's history, applications, and importance.\n  -

Much was said about this dragon, rumored by the villagers to be menacing, but Aria saw something else\u2014warmth and gentleness.\\n\\n\\\"It seems you are not here to frighten me, noble creature,\\\" Princess Aria said with a gentle smile, her words echoing peaceably in the silence.\\n\\nThe dragon, known as Eldrid, bowed his great head in reply. He was laden with secrets and longing to be understood. Together, they spoke, and Aria learned of Eldrid's gift: the power to absorb and store the land's energies, a magic that had long made the dragon a recluse. The villagers feared him, misjudging his intentions. As darkness enveloped their kingdom, Eldrid had grown restless, knowing the force draining his lands was the same one holding the throne of Elvendom in its cold grasp.\\n\\nThe unlikely allies set forth on their quest, traversing Fiona's Peak and crossing Glacier's fell. Along the journey, Aria taught Eldrid about the stars and the stories behind them, while Eldrid shared the ancient lore of the land. Each day, their bond strengthened, a symphony of human wisdom and dragon lore that grew ever more entwined. \\n\\nAs they neared the heart of the darkness, they discovered an ancient sorcery \u2013 a crystalline artifact hidden deep within a cave of frozen dreams. This artifact controlled the shadows, siphoning life from the land for power. With Eldrid's magic and Aria's intellect, they defeated the dark sorcerer who had sought to enslave the kingdom. Light returned to the skies, and peace descended upon the beleaguered land once more.\\n\\nReturning to Elvendom as victors, Princess Aria stood before her kingdom and shared the tale of the misunderstood dragon. The villagers, enlightened by her words, welcomed Eldrid back with honor and gratitude. From that day, the dragon roamed the skies in full glory, and the kingdom flourished under Aria\u2019s wise and courageous leadership.\\n\\nIn this tale, it is clear that it is not grand abilities or solitary bravery that solve the mysteries of the world, but the harmony forged between diverse souls, each offering their unique gifts to the world. Their friendship was the beacon that brought light to the darkness, proving that unity and understanding are the most powerful c\u1ee7a weapons known to man \u2013 a lesson that resonates across time and circumstance.\"}"}

Here are some steps to guide you in creating an impactful piece:\n\n1. **Understand the Forms and Structure**: Familiarize yourself with traditional Chinese poetic forms such as *sh\u012b* (\u8bd7) and *c\u00ed* (\u8bcd). Study the classical structures like the five-character quatrain (*\u4e94\u8a00\u7edd\u53e5*) or the seven-character regulated verse (*\u4e03\u8a00\u5f8b\u8bd7*). Research the specific rules related to tone, rhyme, and parallelism that these forms may require.\n\n2. **Embrace Imagery and Symbolism**: Chinese poetry often uses vivid imagery and symbolism to convey emotions and ideas. Delve into classical Chinese literary symbolism, understanding how natural elements like the moon, mountains, or the lotus flower can carry profound meanings. Use descriptive language to paint clear and evocative pictures in the reader's mind.\n\n3. **Focus on the Theme**: Determine the central theme or emotion you want your poem to convey. Whether it is nature, love, solitude, or social commentary, having a clear focus will guide your word choice and imagery. Explore recurring themes in Chinese poetry, such as the beauty of nature, the ephemerality of life, and the depth of human emotions.\n\n4. **Incorporate Metaphors and Allusions**: Use metaphors and cultural allusions creatively to deepen the layers of meaning in your poem. Referencing Chinese history, classical literature, or ancient philosophies can add richness and depth, resonating with those familiar with the cultural heritage.\n\n5. **Practice Linguistic Precision**: Chinese poetry relies heavily on the precise use of language. Carefully choose words for their sound, tone, and multiple meanings, ensuring each character carries significant weight. Experiment with homophones and tonal variance to add nuanced meaning.\n\n6. **Refine Through Editing**: Write multiple drafts of your poem, paying close attention to cadence, clarity, and the emotional impact of your work. Read it aloud to assess its rhythm and adjust the flow where necessary. Seek feedback from knowledgeable individuals in Chinese poetics to gain perspective on your poem\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n7. **Respect Cultural Elements**: Honor the cultural and historical contexts of the language and poetic form. Be mindful of the traditions that have shaped Chinese poetry over centuries, and aim to capture its essence while adding your own personal voice and perspective.\n\nThese steps will help guide you in crafting a Chinese poem that is both authentic to its roots and expressive of your individual creativity.

Before beginning, ensure you have purchased a toilet model that appropriately fits your bathroom's dimension and plumbing setup. Also, gather all necessary tools and materials, including a wrench, a screwdriver, a wax ring, bolts, a water supply line, a level, plumber's tape, a bucket, sponges, and caulk. \n\n1. **Remove the Old Toilet:** Turn off the water supply at the shut-off valve, usually located near the toilet's base. Flush the toilet to drain as much water as possible from the tank and bowl. Use a sponge and a bucket to soak up any remaining water. Disconnect the water supply line using a wrench. Remove the nuts from the bolts at the toilet base with a wrench, then gently rock the toilet to break the seal and lift it away. Place the old toilet on a tarp to avoid spills or drips on your floor. \n\n2. **Prepare the Flange:** Check the flange on the floor for damage; repair or replace it if necessary. Scrape away any old wax with a putty knife, taking care not to damage the flange or surrounding floor. \n\n3. **Install the Wax Ring:** Place the new wax ring flat side down on the floor flange or on the toilet outlet. Consider warming the wax ring slightly to make it more pliable if it is a chilly day. \n\n4. **Set the New Toilet:** Carefully lift the new toilet bowl over the flange, ensuring the bolts protrude through the mounting holes in the base. Gently lower it onto the wax ring to create a seal. Press down evenly until the toilet base sits flush with the floor. Secure the toilet by tightening the nuts onto the bolts, alternating from side to side to prevent any tilting or uneven pressure. Reattach the tank if it was removed for installation and secure it by tightening the bolts.\n\n5. **Connect the Water Supply:** Attach the water supply line to the toilet tank and tighten securely. Turn on the shut-off valve and allow the tank to fill, checking for leaks around the base and at the water connection. \n\n6. **Ensure Stability and Finish Up:** Use a level to ensure the toilet is even. If necessary, insert toilet shims around the base. Tighten any loose nuts, but avoid over-tightening to prevent damage to the porcelain. Apply a bead of caulk around the toilet base for a clean finish and further stability. \n\n7. **Test Your Installation:** Flush the toilet several times to verify proper operation and check carefully for any leaks around the base and water connections.\n\nBy adhering to these steps, you'll ensure a leak-proof, steady installation that functions efficiently. Always prioritize safety by wearing gloves and safety glasses, and consult local plumbing codes if required for compliance.

Moreover, cultivating soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution can enhance one\u2019s potential for success across different contexts.\\n\\n**Relationships:**\\nBuilding a network of supportive and diverse connections is instrumental. These bonds not only provide guidance but also open doors to new opportunities. Relationships can offer invaluable advice and mentorship, showing how valuable a community can be in sustaining personal and professional growth.\\n\\n**External Influences:**\\nEnvironmental factors, such as a supportive family or inspiring peers, significantly influence one\u2019s approach to challenges and opportunities. Resources like online courses or coaching can also provide structured pathways to acquiring new knowledge and skills. Being mindful of external influences can help navigate both positive and negative impacts, allowing one to create a conducive environment for success.\\n\\nDespite these contributing factors, successful individuals often encounter challenges. One strategy to overcome obstacles is maintaining a clear long-term perspective, which helps prioritize goals and remain focused under stressful situations. Developing adaptability is also crucial, as it allows one to adjust strategies when needed. Building resilience through experience can further assist in handling setbacks more effectively.\"}"}

Let's explore these components and demonstrate how they harmonize to foster success in various domains.\n\n### Personal Attributes\n\n1. **Determination**: The unwavering commitment to goals is vital. People with determination persevere through challenges, refusing to be deterred by setbacks. For instance, Thomas Edison is known for his determination, dedicating years to Perfecting the incandescent bulb despite facing numerous failures.\n\n2. **Resilience**: Pivotal to recovering from adversity and adapting to change. Resilience allows individuals to cope with stress and fluctuating circumstances, whether in a profession, relationship, or personal growth journey. Sarah Breathwohn, a former professional athlete, is a resilient example, adapting her career path and finding success in coaching.\n\n3. **Self-discipline**: This attribute enables consistent effort and focus, essential for long-term progress. Practicing self-discipline allows individuals to stick to their plans, whether it's a rigorous training schedule or a thoughtful writing project. The discipline of Stephen King is evident, as he consistently produces works despite his demanding writing schedule.\n\n### Habits\n\n1. **Goal-setting**: Having clear goals provides direction and purpose. Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals (SMART) helps individuals stay on track and maintain motivation.\n\n2. **Regular Learning**: Cultivating a mindset of continuous learning keeps one abreast with modern developments and opens doors to new opportunities. It involves exploring different subjects and polishing skills. Tim Ferriss is renowned for his habits of learning and experimentation, which he shares through engaging podcast conversations.\n\n3. **Time Management**: Effective time management is crucial for maximizing productivity and achieving goals efficiently. Prioritizing tasks and minimizing distractions are key, as exemplified by Benjamin Franklin's schedule, which allowed him to balance work and personal life effectively.\n\n### External Influences\n\n1. **Supportive Network**: Surrounding oneself with positive influencers can significantly enhance pursuit of goals. Whether it's family, friends, or mentors, a supportive network provides encouragement and guidance at crucial stages. The power of such a network is evident in Angela Duckworth's TED Talk, where she highlights the importance of grit and supportive environments.\n\n2. **Positive Role Models**: Being inspired by successful role models can foster aspiration and provide valuable insights. Observing how they overcome challenges and handling success can influence personal approach to achieving own aspirations. For instance, Malala Yousafzai's advocacy and resilience serve as inspiration to many young activists worldwide.\n\n3. **Resources and Opportunities**: Access to appropriate resources, such as quality education or modern technology, is instrumental in unlocking potential. Governments or organizations often provide resources aimed at fostering growth, like entrepreneurship grants or online courses.\n\n### Integration and Outcome\n\nWhen these components work harmoniously, they create a conducive environment for success.

Let's dive into the workings of 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines to highlight their key differences.\n\n### Operation Overview\n\n#### 2-Stroke Engine:\nA 2-stroke engine completes a power cycle with just two strokes of the piston: the power stroke and the compression stroke. During the power stroke, the fuel-air mixture is ignited, generating power. The simplicity of this cycle results in a higher power-to-weight ratio and faster engine speed. These engines typically use a mix of oil and fuel since they incorporate lubrication directly into the fuel.\n\n#### 4-Stroke Engine:\nA 4-stroke engine, meanwhile, goes through four strokes: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This sequence requires more engine components, making it heavier compared to 2-stroke engines. The power stroke in a 4-stroke engine occurs only once every two crankshaft revolutions, leading to lower engine speed and more controlled power delivery. Generally, these engines use fuel without onboard lubrication, relying on a separate oil system for lubrication.\n\n### Efficiency and Performance:\n\n- **Power Output:** 2-stroke engines are known for delivering their power more rapidly and in a concentrated form due to their simple cycle, which often results in higher horsepower-to-weight ratios. However, they tend to have less overall torque at lower speeds. Four-stroke engines tend to provide more consistent and Lower-End torque, emphasizing controlled performance.\n\n- **Fuel Consumption:** 4-stroke engines generally have better fuel efficiency, especially under steady cruising conditions, where they can offer improved mileage. 2-stroke engines, while more powerful in certain scenarios, consume more fuel relative to their power output.\n\n### Maintenance and Emissions:\n\n- **Maintenance:** 2-stroke engines are often simpler and lighter, which makes them easier to maintain and repair. However, they require regular\u00f2il-fuel blending and frequent cleaning to maintain efficiency.

Let's dive into the workings of 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines to highlight their key differences.\\n\\n### Operation Overview\\n\\n#### 2-Stroke Engine:\\nA 2-stroke engine completes a power cycle with just two strokes of the piston: the power stroke and the compression stroke. During the power stroke, the fuel-air mixture is ignited, generating power. The simplicity of this cycle results in a higher power-to-weight ratio and faster engine speed. These engines typically use a mix of oil and fuel since they incorporate lubrication directly into the fuel.\\n\\n#### 4-Stroke Engine:\\nA 4-stroke engine, meanwhile, goes through four strokes: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. This sequence requires more engine components, making it heavier compared to 2-stroke engines. The power stroke in a 4-stroke engine occurs only once every two crankshaft revolutions, leading to lower engine speed and more controlled power delivery. Generally, these engines use fuel without onboard lubrication, relying on a separate oil system for lubrication.\\n\\n### Efficiency and Performance:\\n\\n- **Power Output:** 2-stroke engines are known for delivering their power more rapidly and in a concentrated form due to their simple cycle, which often results in higher horsepower-to-weight ratios. However, they tend to have less overall torque at lower speeds. Four-stroke engines tend to provide more consistent and Lower-End torque, emphasizing controlled performance.\\n\\n- **Fuel Consumption:** 4-stroke engines generally have better fuel efficiency, especially under steady cruising conditions, where they can offer improved mileage. 2-stroke engines, while more powerful in certain scenarios, consume more fuel relative to their power output.\\n\\n### Maintenance and Emissions:\\n\\n- **Maintenance:** 2-stroke engines are often simpler and lighter, which makes them easier to maintain and repair. However, they require regular\u00f2il-fuel blending and frequent cleaning to maintain efficiency. Four-stroke engines have more complex systems but tend to have fewer service requirements overall, with a focus on oil changes and more standardized components. \\n\\n- **Emissions:** Four-stroke engines are often more environmentally friendly in standard configurations as they separate combustion and exhaust. This architecture leads to lower unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emissions compared to 2-stroke engines, which directly exhaust combustion products. However, advanced technologies can significantly reduce emissions from 2-stroke engines as well.\\n\\n### Suitability:\\n- **Applications:** 2-stroke engines are commonly found in lightweight equipment like motorcycles, lawnmowers, and small boats, where weight is a critical factor.
