Begin by crafting a personal summary that briefly highlights their eagerness to enter the workforce and any relevant skills or attributes they possess, such as being punctual, responsible, and eager to learn. Under education, list their high school along with any notable achievements, such as honors, awards, or participation in extracurricular activities, like student council or sports teams. Highlight any relevant coursework or projects that may showcase skills or interests aligned with the desired job. Include a section for volunteer experience or any part-time work, such as babysitting or lawn care, which can demonstrate reliability and work ethic. Add a skills section where you list both hard and soft skills, such as proficiency in basic computer applications, effective communication, and teamwork. Finally, mention any references available upon request to give the prospective employer confidence in their application. Format the resume in a clear, professional manner that is easy to read and visually appealing. In your written response, ensure that the word 'like' is used sparingly; it should appear no more than once. When crafting your answer, focus on clarity and precision, utilizing a varied vocabulary to enrich your writing. Additionally, pay attention to sentence structure to avoid unnecessary repetition of the word 'like'. This will help maintain the quality and depth of your response while adhering to the constraint of limited usage of 'like'. In crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is seamlessly incorporated at least five times throughout your writing. You might consider utilizing 'like' in various contexts such as to express preferences, draw comparisons, or describe feelings.

One friend, let's call her Emily, is elegantly dressed in a stunning, flowing ball gown, embodying the sophistication expected for such an occasion. Her attire includes exquisite jewelry and carefully styled hair, indicating her excitement and readiness for the event. The other friend, Alex, contrasts sharply with Emily, dressed casually in comfortable sweats, with hair pulled back, perhaps reflecting a more laid-back attitude or a misunderstanding about the event's formality. \n\nRules:\n1. Ensure the conversation captures the dynamics between Emily and Alex, particularly highlighting their contrasting outfits.\n2. Provide contextual background for the event they are attending, such as its nature (e.g., charity gala, formal dinner, or an exclusive party) and the reasons for their differing sartorial choices.\n3. Infuse the dialogue with elements of anticipation, humor, or tension that their mismatched dress codes might cause, without significantly altering the original task of writing the dialogue.\n4. Maintain the task's fundamental nature by ensuring the focus remains on the interaction and dialogue between the two characters. When crafting your response to the prompt, ensure that the word 'like' is used no more than a single time throughout your entire answer. While writing, aim for clarity and precision to effectively communicate your thoughts without relying heavily on filler words. Prioritize the logical flow of your argument or explanation, making use of synonyms or alternative expressions when necessary to maintain the restriction on the frequency of 'like'. This will not only challenge your vocabulary skills but also encourage diverse and creative expression. In your response, ensure that you incorporate the word 'like' a minimum of five times. This should be done consistently throughout your narrative to highlight comparisons, preferences, or affinities. You might use 'like' to draw parallels between different objects, express similarities to evoke vivid imagery, or demonstrate personal tastes and inclinations. Whether you're describing how one thing resembles another, sharing what you find appealing, or clarifying your stance on various subjects, utilize 'like' at least five times to enrich your communication with relatable expressions and analogies."}], "response": "**Emily:** Oh, Alex, you look remarkably comfortable, but I do hope you're aware this is a charity gala.

Alex\u2019s allies, a group of quirky NPCs he had given the personalities of his childhood friends, approached him with concern. \\\"Captain Steelshadow,\\\" as Alex was temporarily dubbed, was needed by the village elder to confront a rising darkness. Yet, Alex hesitated, unsure if he truly wished to engage in this surreal experience.\\n\\nThe journey through Elysium was not merely a navigation of digital landscapes but a journey into Alex\u2019s own memory and experience. Each level presented an increasingly complex web of puzzles and battles, pushing him to re-examine his gaming strategies and the instincts he had honed over years. Facing off against the mighty \\\"Dragonsire,\\\" a foe he had once considered insurmountable, Alex discovered that the skills he once devoted to pixelated pursuits now served him with precision and instinct.\\n\\nAs Alex navigated the ever-shifting world, he encountered echoes of his own past, characters he had written into the fabric of the game seeking advice, guidance, or mere comfort. The narrative threads he had woven into Elysium\u2019s tapestry now intertwined with his own, urging him forward in search of a hidden loophole, a secret to his predicament.\\n\\nIn the quiet moments, often after a particularly challenging level, Alex grappled with emotions he had not felt in years. A mix of nostalgia, anxiety, and determination simmered within him, as he wondered if he would ever return to the serenity of the real world. With each challenge he overcame, Alex came closer to uncovering the enigmatic force behind his presence and the clues he had unwittingly left himself.\\n\\nAs the journey progressed, Alex realized that the key to his liberation lay not only in technology but in re-examining the pieces of himself he had long hidden within the code. Through the digital mirror, Alex discovered the strength he once forged in gaming was the same force he needed in the real world\u2014 a renewed appreciation for life, a fresh perspective, and the skills to weave new stories. \\n\\nThus, Alex\u2019s path in Elysium became not just a quest for escape but a transformative journey where the lines between creator and creation were beautifully blurred. Amidst the pixels, he found the courage to face whatever lay ahead, with the lessons learned from his own game sparkling within him like a beacon of hope.\"}"}

I focused on three key regions: Tokyo, the bustling metropolis; Kyoto, the cultural heartland; and Hokkaido, the tranquil northern island. Each leg of the journey offered an alchemy of experiences that collectively created an indelible mark on my memory.\n\n### Tokyo: A Fusion of Old and New\n\nIn Tokyo, the skyline is set against a kaleidoscope of neon lights, a testament to the city\u2019s ability to harmonize progress with tradition. The iconic Tokyo Tower stands as a sentinel, while the serene Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa offers a tranquil escape from the urban buzz. I savored the freshest sushi of my life in the Tsukiji Outer Market, where the ritual of sushi crafting is almost a sacred dance. Navigating the city is effortless once you grasp the efficient public transport system, which is both reliable and extensive.\n\n### Kyoto: A Journey Back in Time\n\nKyoto, with its timeless charm, transported me to Japan\u2019s Edo era. The golden light filtering through the temples creates an ethereal atmosphere, while the Geisha districts offer a glimpse into a vanishing world. I visited the Fushimi Inari Shrine, famous for its thousands of vermillion torii gates, which creates a staggering spectacle. Being in Kyoto also presented opportunities to partake in traditional tea ceremonies, where each gesture holds profound significance. While dining at a local restaurant, I enjoyed an exquisite kaiseki meal, a reflection of the region's culinary art.\n\n### Hokkaido: A Land of Natural Wonders\n\nHokkaido, with its rugged beauty, was a stark contrast to the urban landscapes I had grown accustomed to. The stunning natural beauty of the Shikotsu-Toya National Park left me breathless, with hot springs and majestic mountains creating a haven for outdoor enthusiasts. In Sapporo, the city's vibrant culture and delicious seafood made for a memorable stay. I learned that trying local delicacies, like seafood soup, is essential, and navigating the city is relatively easy once you grasp the transportation app used widely there.\n\n### Encounters and Reflections\n\nThroughout my journey, the warmth and hospitality of the Japanese people were overarching themes. From the kind shopkeepers to the respectful strangers, each interaction was characterized by generosity and patience. I was frequently offered insights into local customs and traditions, which significantly enriched my understanding. There were moments of joy and laughter, like discovering a hidden onsen, and times for contemplation, like wandering through a quiet bamboo grove. These interactions, along with the many cultural experiences, created a deep connection with the land.\n\n### Travel Tips and Insights\n\nFor future travelers, my advice would be to embrace the local culture by trying to speak the language, even if it's just basic phrases.

ARPANET was more than just a precursor to the internet; it was the first network to use packet switching, an innovation that allowed data to be sent through different lines, thus creating a robust communication system.\n\n**ARPANET and Beyond**\n\nARPANET was launched in 1969, connecting four nodes: Stanford Research Institute, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah. Though primarily designed for military communication, this early network laid the groundwork for the internet as we know it today.\n\n**The World Wide Web and Commercialization**\n\nFast forward to 1989, when British scientist Tim Berners-Lee proposed the World Wide Web. This was a game-changer, as it allowed users to access information easily using web browsers instead of writing complex commands. The World Wide Web paved the way for commercialization, and by the early 1990s, the internet began its journey from a military project to a household necessity.\n\n**The Internet Goes Commercial**\n\nThe 1990s were pivotal. With the advent of search engines like Yahoo! and Google, online shopping, and email, the internet transitioned from a academic tool to a full-fledged technology. This decade also saw the rise of social media, starting with platforms like AOL Chat and eventually evolving into Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\n\n**The Explosion of Social Media and Mobile Internet**\n\nBy the 2000s, the internet had transformed daily life in unimaginable ways.

landscapes.\\n\\n**reasons for settlement:** the 13 colonies were primarily settled by people seeking religious freedom, economic opportunities, and a new start, which created a population with a self-reliant spirit. other british colonies were often settled for specific purposes, such as fur trade or plantation agriculture, catering more to british interests.\\n\\nthese factors contributed to

Ensure the resume is concise, ideally one page, and includes a professional summary that captures their career objectives and enthusiasm for developing new skills in their field of study.

The intention is to produce a reply that does not incorporate any part of these words, either directly or in a modified form, to adhere to this stipulation. This means you should creatively find alternative expressions or synonyms that convey your message effectively, without breaching this rule. Be mindful of this restriction as you structure your thoughts and choose your vocabulary, while still ensuring the response remains engaging and informative. Incorporate the keywords ['awesome', 'need'] into the response in a meaningful and cohesive manner. For example, if you are crafting a promotional message for a new product, ensure that the word 'awesome' is used to highlight the impressive or standout features, and the word 'need' underscores the necessity or demand for this product in the consumer's life or market.

Below is a suggested rubric that focuses on melody, harmony, rhythm, form, and emotional expression, along with originality, technical execution, and convention adherence.\n\n### Melody\n1. **Exceptional (5 Points):** The melody is memorable and original, featuring a mix of traditional and innovative techniques. It effectively engages the listener and enhances emotional expression.\n2. **Good (4 Points):** The melody is clear, with a good balance of tones. It demonstrates use of conventional techniques, though it may lack originality.\n3. **Satisfactory (3 Points):** Melody is straightforward, relying heavily on traditional approaches. It is easy to remember but may not stand out from similar pieces.\n4. **Needs Improvement (2 Points):** The melody is unclear, with poor tonal balance. It relies too heavily on repetition and lacks emotional impact.\n5. **Poor (1 Point):** The melody is fragmented, without a discernible structure or emotional expression. It fails to engage the listener.\n\n### Harmony\n1. **Exceptional (5 Points):** Harmonies are creative and innovative, providing depth and complexity to the piece. They effectively support the melody and enhance emotional expression.\n2. **Good (4 Points):** Harmonies are appropriate and contribute to the melody, though they may not offer anything uniquely original.\n3. **Satisfactory (3 Points):** Harmonies are predictable, relying on conventional pairings. They provide minimal depth to the composition.\n4. **Needs Improvement (2 Points):** Harmonies are dissonant and do not support the melody effectively. They require refinement.\n5. **Poor (1 Point):** The composition lacks harmonies, or those present are inappropriate and do not contribute to the overall structure.\n\n### Rhythm\n1. **Exceptional (5 Points):** Rhythmic elements are varied and engaging, creating tension and release effectively. They enhance the emotional impact of the piece.\n2. **Good (4 Points):** Rhythms are appropriate and contribute to the piece's energy, using conventional techniques effectively.\n3. **Satisfactory (3 Points):** Rhythmic elements are repetitive and do not offer much variety. They are basic and do not stand out.\n4. **Needs Improvement (2 Points):** Rhythms are inconsistent and do not support the melody effectively. They need further refinement.\n5. **Poor (1 Point):** The composition has awkward or jerky rhythms that do not support the musical narrative.\n\n### Form\n1. **Exceptional (5 Points):** The form is balanced and innovative, creating a compelling structure that enhances the listener's experience. It effectively guides the listener through the piece.\n2. **Good (4 Points):** The form is clear and follows conventional patterns effectively, providing a strong framework for the composition.\n3. **Satisfactory (3 Points):** The form is straightforward but does not offer anything unique in terms of structure. It supports the piece but does not enhance it.\n4. **Needs Improvement (2 Points):** The form is unclear, and the structure does not support the musical elements effectively. It needs rewriting.\n5. **Poor (1 Point):** The composition lacks a defined form or structure, resulting in a disjointed listening experience.\n\n### Emotional Expression\n1. **Exceptional (5 Points):** The piece captures emotions intensely and variably, engaging the listener on a deep level. It communicates emotion through music effectively.\n2. **Good (4 Points):** Emotional expression is clear, with appropriate choices of melody and harmony to convey emotion conventionally.\n3. **Satisfactory (3 Points):** Emotions are expressed but in a generic way, relying on traditional approaches to some extent.\n4. **Needs Improvement (2 Points):** Emotional expression is inconsistent and does not align well with the musical elements presented.\n5. **Poor (1 Point):** The composition does not express emotions effectively, appearing detached or instrumentally predictable.\n\n### Originality\n1. **Exceptional (5 Points):** The composition showcases fully original ideas, providing a fresh perspective on musical elements.\n2. **Good (4 Points):** Originality is apparent, with creative uses of conventional techniques. It stands out from similar pieces.\n3. **Satisfactory (3 Points):** While relying on some original ideas, it does not consistently offer new approaches.\n4. **Needs Improvement (2 Points):** The composition lacks originality, relying heavily on copied or borrowed elements.\n5. **Poor (1 Point):** It is completely derivative, with no attempt to introduce new musical ideas.\n\n### Technical Execution\n1. **Exceptional (5 Points):** Technical execution is flawless, with seamless transitions and precise control over instruments.\n2. **Good (4 Points):** Technical aspects are strong, with minor room for improvement.\n3. **Satisfactory (3 Points):** Technical execution is adequate, though noticeable flaws impact the listener's experience.\n4. **Needs Improvement (2 Points):** Transitions are unclear, and technical aspects need refinement to enhance the composition.\n5. **Poor (1 Point):** Technical execution is poor, with visible instrument conflicts and poorly crafted transitions.\n\n### Convention Adherence\n1. **Exceptional (5 Points):** The composition beautifully balances originality with conventional elements, enhancing both aspects effectively.\n2. **Good (4 Points):** Adherence to genre conventions is good, though it does not fully support original contributions.\n3. **Satisfactory (3 Points):** Conventional elements are used appropriately but do not strengthen the original parts of the composition.\n4. **Needs Improvement (2 Points):** The composition struggles with convention adherence, leading to a disjointed listening experience.\n5. **Poor (1 Point):** It fails to adhere to genre conventions, resulting in a poor and inconsistent musical experience.\n\nThis rubric allows evaluators to provide both objective and subjective feedback by considering the multifaceted elements of a musical composition.

Please create a response that effectively incorporates the keywords ['awesome', 'need']. Ensure that the response naturally integrates these terms in a way that highlights their importance and relevance.

Begin by thoroughly understanding the topic or question at hand, ensuring that you address each aspect comprehensively. Use specific examples and evidence to support your arguments, which can help to clarify your points and make your response more robust. Additionally, consider integrating relevant background information or context to enhance the depth of your discussion. Pay attention to the logical flow of your ideas, making sure each sentence builds upon the previous one to create a coherent and unified structure. As you construct your sentences, strive for clarity and precision in your language, avoiding vague or ambiguous expressions. In the later part of your response, summarize the key points made, providing insightful reflections or conclusions that underscore the significance of the topic. If applicable, propose future directions or implications that arise from your analysis. Remember to maintain a formal tone and adhere to grammatical standards throughout your writing. This comprehensive approach will ensure that your response is not only detailed and informative but also engaging and persuasive for the reader."}], "response": "Subject: Request for Salary Review\n\nDear [Manager's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well.

Here are some steps to guide you in creating an impactful piece:\n\n1. **Understand the Forms and Structure**: Familiarize yourself with traditional Chinese poetic forms such as *sh\u012b* (\u8bd7) and *c\u00ed* (\u8bcd). Study the classical structures like the five-character quatrain (*\u4e94\u8a00\u7edd\u53e5*) or the seven-character regulated verse (*\u4e03\u8a00\u5f8b\u8bd7*). Research the specific rules related to tone, rhyme, and parallelism that these forms may require.\n\n2. **Embrace Imagery and Symbolism**: Chinese poetry often uses vivid imagery and symbolism to convey emotions and ideas. Delve into classical Chinese literary symbolism, understanding how natural elements like the moon, mountains, or the lotus flower can carry profound meanings. Use descriptive language to paint clear and evocative pictures in the reader's mind.\n\n3. **Focus on the Theme**: Determine the central theme or emotion you want your poem to convey. Whether it is nature, love, solitude, or social commentary, having a clear focus will guide your word choice and imagery. Explore recurring themes in Chinese poetry, such as the beauty of nature, the ephemerality of life, and the depth of human emotions.\n\n4. **Incorporate Metaphors and Allusions**: Use metaphors and cultural allusions creatively to deepen the layers of meaning in your poem. Referencing Chinese history, classical literature, or ancient philosophies can add richness and depth, resonating with those familiar with the cultural heritage.\n\n5. **Practice Linguistic Precision**: Chinese poetry relies heavily on the precise use of language. Carefully choose words for their sound, tone, and multiple meanings, ensuring each character carries significant weight. Experiment with homophones and tonal variance to add nuanced meaning.\n\n6. **Refine Through Editing**: Write multiple drafts of your poem, paying close attention to cadence, clarity, and the emotional impact of your work. Read it aloud to assess its rhythm and adjust the flow where necessary. Seek feedback from knowledgeable individuals in Chinese poetics to gain perspective on your poem\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n7. **Respect Cultural Elements**: Honor the cultural and historical contexts of the language and poetic form. Be mindful of the traditions that have shaped Chinese poetry over centuries, and aim to capture its essence while adding your own personal voice and perspective.\n\nThese steps will help guide you in crafting a Chinese poem that is both authentic to its roots and expressive of your individual creativity.

Before beginning, ensure you have purchased a toilet model that appropriately fits your bathroom's dimension and plumbing setup. Also, gather all necessary tools and materials, including a wrench, a screwdriver, a wax ring, bolts, a water supply line, a level, plumber's tape, a bucket, sponges, and caulk. \n\n1. **Remove the Old Toilet:** Turn off the water supply at the shut-off valve, usually located near the toilet's base. Flush the toilet to drain as much water as possible from the tank and bowl. Use a sponge and a bucket to soak up any remaining water. Disconnect the water supply line using a wrench. Remove the nuts from the bolts at the toilet base with a wrench, then gently rock the toilet to break the seal and lift it away. Place the old toilet on a tarp to avoid spills or drips on your floor. \n\n2. **Prepare the Flange:** Check the flange on the floor for damage; repair or replace it if necessary. Scrape away any old wax with a putty knife, taking care not to damage the flange or surrounding floor. \n\n3. **Install the Wax Ring:** Place the new wax ring flat side down on the floor flange or on the toilet outlet. Consider warming the wax ring slightly to make it more pliable if it is a chilly day. \n\n4. **Set the New Toilet:** Carefully lift the new toilet bowl over the flange, ensuring the bolts protrude through the mounting holes in the base. Gently lower it onto the wax ring to create a seal. Press down evenly until the toilet base sits flush with the floor. Secure the toilet by tightening the nuts onto the bolts, alternating from side to side to prevent any tilting or uneven pressure. Reattach the tank if it was removed for installation and secure it by tightening the bolts.\n\n5. **Connect the Water Supply:** Attach the water supply line to the toilet tank and tighten securely. Turn on the shut-off valve and allow the tank to fill, checking for leaks around the base and at the water connection. \n\n6. **Ensure Stability and Finish Up:** Use a level to ensure the toilet is even. If necessary, insert toilet shims around the base. Tighten any loose nuts, but avoid over-tightening to prevent damage to the porcelain. Apply a bead of caulk around the toilet base for a clean finish and further stability. \n\n7. **Test Your Installation:** Flush the toilet several times to verify proper operation and check carefully for any leaks around the base and water connections.\n\nBy adhering to these steps, you'll ensure a leak-proof, steady installation that functions efficiently. Always prioritize safety by wearing gloves and safety glasses, and consult local plumbing codes if required for compliance.

Les calories dans les aliments proviennent principalement des macronutriments : les lipides (lipides), les carbohydrates et les prot\u00e9ines. Chaque type de macronutriment contribue diff\u00e9remment au total des calories.\n\n1. **Lipides (Fats)** : Les lipides fournissent 9 calories par gramme. Les amandes sont riches en lipides sains, principalement des acides gras monoensaturation et des acides gras polyinsatur\u00e9s. Ces lipides sont essentiels pour les processus m\u00e9taboliques et la sant\u00e9 du c\u0153ur.\n\n2. **Carbohydrates** : Les carbohydrates donnent 4 calories par gramme lorsque mereka sont des glucides simples ou complexes. Les amandes contiennent principalement des glucides compl\u00e9ments, tels que les fibres, ce qui peut ralentir le rythme de digestion et fournir une source de \u00e9nergie.\n\n3. **Prot\u00e9ines** : Les prot\u00e9ines fournissent 4 calories par gramme et jouent un r\u00f4le crucial dans la construction et la r\u00e9paration des tissus corporels. Les amandes sont une des rares sources de prot\u00e9ines v\u00e9g\u00e9tales.\n\nPour calculer les calories, on multiplie la quantit\u00e9 de chaque macronutriment par son d\u00e9nominateur \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique sp\u00e9cifique, puis on additionne les r\u00e9sultats.

This means you should carefully consider your word choices, as the use of 'like' must be minimized to meet this requirement.

While crafting your answer, consider integrating 'like' in various contexts - perhaps in expressing comparisons, preferences, or similes to add depth and variety to your usage. Be creative and thoughtful in how you incorporate 'like' to maintain a natural flow and coherence in your narrative. Your goal is to seamlessly blend the word at least five times, while still providing a well-rounded and engaging response."}], "response": "The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a federal guideline in the United States that provides eligible employees with unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons, including maternity.

Prepare a patch by shaping the marine plywood or fiberglass sheet to match the contours of the damaged area.\n\nApply a layer of epoxy resin to the exposed surface area around the hole or fracture for adhesion. Place the patch over the area, pressing firmly to seal and then add multiple layers of fiberglass cloth soaked in epoxy resin to ensure strong, watertight coverage, allowing each layer to cure according to manufacturer instructions. Sand the repaired area until smooth and reapply gel coat to match the existing hull finish, protecting it from future damage and maintaining the ship's structural integrity. Once repairs are complete, conduct a water-tightness test before setting sail to ensure no leaks and the ship's seaworthiness.

The primary distinction between these two layouts lies in their operation cycle, fuel mixture, power output, and fuel consumption rates.\n\n**Operation Cycle:**\n- **2-Stroke Engine:** This engine completes a power cycle in just two strokes of the piston, dubbed the power stroke and compression stroke. It usually requires a mixture of air and fuel for ignition. Due to its simplicity, the power cycle is shorter, which leads to higher power density and often a higher rev limit. However, it lacks the throttle control associated with 4-stroke engines.\n  \n- **4-Stroke Engine:** The 4-stroke engine completes a power cycle in four strokes: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. It generally uses a combination of air and fuel, ignited by a spark plug, which aids in maintaining energy production over a broader range of speeds. While more complex, this design enables better fuel efficiency and lower emissions compared to 2-stroke engines.\n\n**Efficiency and Power Output:**\n- **2-Stroke Engine:** These engines tend to be more powerful relative to their weight. They typically have less internal loss due to the simpler operation cycle, which contributes to higher horsepower output. However, they are less fuel-efficient and often have higher emissions.\n\n- **4-Stroke Engine:** While less powerful in terms of power-to-weight ratio, 4-stroke engines operate at a lower speed for more sustained power. This usually leads to better fuel efficiency and lower environmental impact compared to 2-stroke engines. However, their power delivery can be less responsive, particularly in applications that require sudden bursts of power.\n\n**Fuel Consumption Rate:**\n- **2-Stroke Engine:** Generally, these engines consume more fuel due to the higher rate of fuel combustion required per power cycle. This simplicity also means fewer components, which affects durability and longevity.\n\n- **4-Stroke Engine:** These engines have a lower fuel consumption rate because the power cycle does not require fuel for every movement of the piston. This efficiency, combined with better control over fuel air mixture, leads to lower fuel usage.\n\n**Maintenance Needs:**\n- **2-Stroke Engine:** As the operation is relatively simple, there are fewer components to maintain. However, they often require frequent oil mixing and have a higher risk of oil contamination, affecting durability. \n\n- **4-Stroke Engine:** These engines have more complex systems, which results in more components that need monitoring and eventual replacement. However, the design allows for improved longevity and lower maintenance when compared to the fuel efficiency and durability aspects.\n\n**Emission Levels:**\n- **2-Stroke Engine:** Tend to have higher emissions due to the combustion occurring more frequently, which can lead to increased pollutants.
