Constraint 1: In crafting your response, be mindful that the word 'like' should be used sparingly, appearing no more than once throughout your entire text. This limitation encourages creativity in your word choice and ensures clarity and conciseness in communication.

Constraint 2: When crafting your response, ensure that the word 'like' is included at least five times throughout your writing. This requirement aims to assess your ability to effectively incorporate a specific term repeatedly in a coherent and natural manner. Consider constructing sentences where 'like' serves different functions, such as expressing similarity, preference, or as a filler word in conversational style.

One friend, let's call her Emily, is elegantly dressed in a stunning, flowing ball gown, embodying the sophistication expected for such an occasion. Her attire includes exquisite jewelry and carefully styled hair, indicating her excitement and readiness for the event. The other friend, Alex, contrasts sharply with Emily, dressed casually in comfortable sweats, with hair pulled back, perhaps reflecting a more laid-back attitude or a misunderstanding about the event's formality. \n\nRules:\n1. Ensure the conversation captures the dynamics between Emily and Alex, particularly highlighting their contrasting outfits.\n2. Provide contextual background for the event they are attending, such as its nature (e.g., charity gala, formal dinner, or an exclusive party) and the reasons for their differing sartorial choices.\n3. Infuse the dialogue with elements of anticipation, humor, or tension that their mismatched dress codes might cause, without significantly altering the original task of writing the dialogue.\n4.

This should be done consistently throughout your narrative to highlight comparisons, preferences, or affinities. You might use 'like' to draw parallels between different objects, express similarities to evoke vivid imagery, or demonstrate personal tastes and inclinations. Whether you're describing how one thing resembles another, sharing what you find appealing, or clarifying your stance on various subjects, utilize 'like' at least five times to enrich your communication with relatable expressions and analogies."}], "response": "**Emily:** Wow, Alex, you look remarkably relaxed for our evening at the gala.

From a philosophical standpoint, advocating for the disobedience of unjust laws can be rooted in moral reasoning, where individuals believe it is their duty to oppose laws that violate fundamental principles of justice and human rights. Historical examples, such as civil rights activists in the United States or anti-apartheid fighters in South Africa, demonstrate the power of individual action in transforming unjust legal systems. Their efforts often involved disregarding laws to bring attention to the need for reform and ensure the protection of fundamental human dignity.\n\nHowever, the path to revising unjust laws is often fraught with challenges. Disregarding laws without a structured, collective approach can lead to societal discord, undermining the stability essential for lawful societies. Without an organized route to amendment, individuals or fringe groups might selectively choose which laws to follow, eroding the rule of law and creating anarchy. This can result in unintended consequences, such as vigilantism or the escalation of tensions within society.\n\nMoreover, the processes in place for amending laws are designed to balance individual rights with societal order.

Les murs, qui jadis \u00e9taient grises et monotones, pr\u00e9sent\u00e8rent tous d'abord des couleurs vives et des symboles myst\u00e9rieux.

Les travaux sur ce qui allait devenir l'internet ont commenc\u00e9 fort loin dans les ann\u00e9es 1960. Sur le territoire des \u00c9tats-Unis, un projet appel\u00e9 ARPANET (le r\u00e9seau d'ARPA) a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 par le gouvernement am\u00e9ricain. L'objectif \u00e9tait simple : cr\u00e9er un r\u00e9seau de communications qui puisse lier des ordinateurs entre eux. Bien qu'il ne soit pas imm\u00e9diatement visible du grand public, ARPANET est le p\u00e8re des r\u00e9seaux modernes.\n\n**La Naissance Du World Wide Web**\n\nFast-forward aux ann\u00e9es 1980, un jeune chercheur du Royaume-Uni nomm\u00e9 Tim Berners-Lee travaillait sur une id\u00e9e r\u00e9volutionnaire : rendre l'acc\u00e8s aux ressources en ligne plus facile et accessible \u00e0 tous. Il inventa le World Wide Web (WWW), un syst\u00e8me permettant de naviguer entre les sites web en utilisant des hyperliens. Cet innovant syst\u00e8me a transform\u00e9 l'internet en une sorte de \u00ab biblioth\u00e8que du monde \u00bb que l'on peut explorer \u00e0 distance.\n\n**La Mont\u00e9e Des R\u00e9seaux Sociaux**\n\nDans les ann\u00e9es 2000, les r\u00e9seaux sociaux sont n\u00e9s. MySpace, Facebook et Twitter ont rapidement pris en charge les communications personnelles en substituant les courriers et conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. Maintenant, il est possible de rester connect\u00e9 avec n\u2019importe qui, \u00e0 n\u2019importe quelle heure, et de partager chaque instant de votre vie.\n\n**L\u2019\u00c9mergence Des Smartphones**\n\nArrivez les smartphones, qui ont encore accentu\u00e9 l'influence de l'internet. Maintenant que la connectivit\u00e9 internet est \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main, les utilisateurs peuvent acc\u00e9der imm\u00e9diatement aux r\u00e9seaux sociaux, regarder des vid\u00e9os, utiliser des applications d'apprentissage, tout en \u00e9tant connect\u00e9 en temps r\u00e9el.\n\n**Impacts Sur La Vie Journ\u00e9e**\n\nMaintenant, respirons profond\u00e9ment et regardons les impacts consid\u00e9rables de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements sur nos vies personnelles et collectives.\n\n1. **Communication :** Oui, les emails et les messages texto ne sont plus de mode, mais les applications modernes permettent des conversations en temps r\u00e9el, comme les appels vocaux sur WhatsApp ou les vid\u00e9os sur TikTok.\n\n2. **Education :** Les ressources d\u2019apprentissage disponibles en ligne ont augment\u00e9 drastiquement. Les \u00e9tudiants peuvent maintenant seFormer sans restrictions de fronti\u00e8res et participer \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences virtuelles.\n\n3. **Divertissement :** La t\u00e9l\u00e9vision n'est plus l'unique source de divertissement. YouTube, Netflix et les podcasts offrent une infinit\u00e9 de contenus pour s\u2019occuper les veilles.\n\n4. **Interaction Sociale :** Les r\u00e9seaux sociaux ont transform\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on de s\u2019exprimer et de se connecter avec les autres.

Partons voyageur et d\u00e9couvrons ensemble les \u00e9v\u00e9nements cl\u00e9s qui ont port\u00e9 cette technologie incontournable \u00e0 sa pleine maturit\u00e9.\\n\\n**Les D\u00e9buts Des Ann\u00e9es 1960**\\n\\nL'internet n'est pas une invention r\u00e9cente. Les travaux sur ce qui allait devenir l'internet ont commenc\u00e9 fort loin dans les ann\u00e9es 1960. Sur le territoire des \u00c9tats-Unis, un projet appel\u00e9 ARPANET (le r\u00e9seau d'ARPA) a \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 par le gouvernement am\u00e9ricain. L'objectif \u00e9tait simple : cr\u00e9er un r\u00e9seau de communications qui puisse lier des ordinateurs entre eux. Bien qu'il ne soit pas imm\u00e9diatement visible du grand public, ARPANET est le p\u00e8re des r\u00e9seaux modernes.\\n\\n**La Naissance Du World Wide Web**\\n\\nFast-forward aux ann\u00e9es 1980, un jeune chercheur du Royaume-Uni nomm\u00e9 Tim Berners-Lee travaillait sur une id\u00e9e r\u00e9volutionnaire : rendre l'acc\u00e8s aux ressources en ligne plus facile et accessible \u00e0 tous. Il inventa le World Wide Web (WWW), un syst\u00e8me permettant de naviguer entre les sites web en utilisant des hyperliens. Cet innovant syst\u00e8me a transform\u00e9 l'internet en une sorte de \u00ab biblioth\u00e8que du monde \u00bb que l'on peut explorer \u00e0 distance.\\n\\n**La Mont\u00e9e Des R\u00e9seaux Sociaux**\\n\\nDans les ann\u00e9es 2000, les r\u00e9seaux sociaux sont n\u00e9s. MySpace, Facebook et Twitter ont rapidement pris en charge les communications personnelles en substituant les courriers et conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques. Maintenant, il est possible de rester connect\u00e9 avec n\u2019importe qui, \u00e0 n\u2019importe quelle heure, et de partager chaque instant de votre vie.\\n\\n**L\u2019\u00c9mergence Des Smartphones**\\n\\nArrivez les smartphones, qui ont encore accentu\u00e9 l'influence de l'internet. Maintenant que la connectivit\u00e9 internet est \u00e0 port\u00e9e de main, les utilisateurs peuvent acc\u00e9der imm\u00e9diatement aux r\u00e9seaux sociaux, regarder des vid\u00e9os, utiliser des applications d'apprentissage, tout en \u00e9tant connect\u00e9 en temps r\u00e9el.\\n\\n**Impacts Sur La Vie Journ\u00e9e**\\n\\nMaintenant, respirons profond\u00e9ment et regardons les impacts consid\u00e9rables de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements sur nos vies personnelles et collectives.\\n\\n1. **Communication :** Oui, les emails et les messages texto ne sont plus de mode, mais les applications modernes permettent des conversations en temps r\u00e9el, comme les appels vocaux sur WhatsApp ou les vid\u00e9os sur TikTok.\\n\\n2. **Education :** Les ressources d\u2019apprentissage disponibles en ligne ont augment\u00e9 drastiquement. Les \u00e9tudiants peuvent maintenant seFormer sans restrictions de fronti\u00e8res et participer \u00e0 des conf\u00e9rences virtuelles.\\n\\n3. **Divertissement :** La t\u00e9l\u00e9vision n'est plus l'unique source de divertissement. YouTube, Netflix et les podcasts offrent une infinit\u00e9 de contenus pour s\u2019occuper les veilles.\\n\\n4. **Interaction Sociale :** Les r\u00e9seaux sociaux ont transform\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on de s\u2019exprimer et de se connecter avec les autres. Mais ils ont aussi pouss\u00e9 certaines personnes \u00e0 s\u2019enfermer en eux-m\u00eames, prouvant qu\u2019en tout cas, la connexion est toujours pr\u00e9sente.\\n\\nEn conclusion, l'internet a non seulement chang\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont nous vivons, mais il continue de s\u2019\u00e9voluer pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 nos besoins croissants.

I began my day with a particularly demanding work project that included numerous deadlines and an increasingly complex set of tasks. As I delved deeper into the project, I felt the weight of responsibility and urgency, which triggered my stress response.\n\nOne of the primary triggers was the time-sensitive nature of the project, leaving me with little room for error. However, I realized early on that adhering to strict deadlines wouldn\u2019t just impact my work but also affect my well-being. So, I decided to employ several stress management strategies to cope with these pressures.\n\nFirstly, I dedicated a short period each hour to deep breathing exercises. Focusing on the flow of air in and out helped to center me and reminded me of the present moment, rather than getting caught in the cycle of anxiety about the future. These exercises were relatively simple yet incredibly effective in calming my nerves.\n\nAnother technique I found helpful was a short walk outside during my lunch break. Surrounded by nature, I noticed a significant decrease in my stress levels. The change in environment and the gentle movement while walking seemed to refresh my mind and rejuvenate my body. These brief moments of connection with the outside world made a substantial difference.\n\nIn the afternoon, I turned to creative expression as a stress reliever. Engaging in some impromptu doodling, I found myself immersed in the creative process, allowing my mind to wander and express emotions without constraint. This act was not only therapeutic but also helped to clarify certain aspects of my project, offering new perspectives.\n\nDespite these strategies bringing me considerable relief, I did encounter some challenges. At times, it was difficult to disconnect from work, even during designated break times. Additionally, the creative outlet didn't work as effectively when I was fatigued, requiring me to prioritize rest to effectively utilize this technique.\n\nIn reflection, while there were moments where stress still lingered, employing these techniques has been immensely beneficial. They have taught me the importance of regularly taking time for myself and showing patience with my abilities. Backed by these experiences, I\u2019m confident that with consistent practice, these strategies will become more ingrained, helping me manage stress more effectively in the future.", "processed_response": "{\"conflict_recognized\": 0, \"processed_response\": \"**June 15th, 2024**\\n\\nToday has been a day filled with both challenges and insights, offering me an opportunity to reflect on my stress management techniques.

official support for kotlin has also increased its presence in the android development ecosystem.\n\n5. **performance:** kotlin compiles to java bytecode, which means it can directly run on java virtual machines (jvms). this ensures near-java performance with the added features of a modern language.\n\n6. **development lifecycle:** kotlin's focus on modern programming paradigms like functional programming and its improved type system can make the development lifecycle more predictable and efficient.\n\n7. **maintenance:** better type safety and reduced null handling make maintenance easier and less error-prone compared to java.\n\n8. **future growth:** as google continues to invest in kotlin, it is likely to remain a key technology in android development, offering opportunities for future growth and updates.\n\n**disadvantages of kotlin:**\n\n1. **learning curve for java developers:** while kotlin is relatively easy to learn, java developers might need to adapt to new concepts and features, which can be a barrier.\n\n2. **fewer resources for advanced scenarios:** though growing, the sheer volume of resources and community focus on java might offer more support for advanced or specialized scenarios.\n\n**advantages of java:**\n\n1. **mature ecosystem:** java has a well-established ecosystem with a wealth of libraries, frameworks, and tools. this

He thought it was the perfect snack to boost his strength. Soon after, the Triceratops joined in, using it as a fancy hair gel to style their frill-like features with a quirky, spiky look that set the fashion trend of the Jurassic period.\\n\\nThe Diplodocus, with its long neck, loved to wear Dino-Mite leaves as fancy headbands, while the Pterodactyls used them to make brilliant aero-gels, allowing them to soar to new heights without a single flap of their wings. Everywhere dinosaurs went, the soft glow of Dino-Mite followed, making them feel like they were part of something extraordinary.\\n\\nHowever, one sunny day, the dinosaurs woke up to find that the Dino-Mite had grown stronger and had spread an unusually potent batch. Instead of the usual blissful buzz, the dinosaurs felt a sudden urge to build the tallest constructions ever seen. The T-Rex started with a grandiose castle, the Triceratops erected a frill-tastic tower, and the Diplodocus built a long, leafy city. \\n\\nThe Pterodactyls, meanwhile, were too busy flying around in formation, weaving magnificent patterns with their path, completely absorbed in their aerial art. The demand for building materials soared, and soon, the entire prehistoric world was covered in towering structures.\\n\\nUnfortunately, all these edifices made an ideal habitat for a swarm of giant, mutated mosquitoes. These mosquitoes had been quietly observing the dinosaurs' obsession and were eager to repay the debt. One night, under the glow of a million stars, these mosquitoes unleashed a torrent of attacks, leaving the dinosaurs in a sticky predicament.\\n\\nDespite their efforts to swat at them, the dinosaurs found themselves exhausted and bogged down, their usually fierce instincts rendered useless against the onslaught. It wasn't the hot, fiery lava or the crashing waves, but a simple, overpowered fad that led to their infamous extinction.\\n\\nAnd so, the dinosaurs vanished, leaving behind a testament to their creativity\u2014and a warning to future creatures: some trends are better left untried.\"}"}

Here are some steps to guide you in creating an impactful piece:\n\n1. **Understand the Forms and Structure**: Familiarize yourself with traditional Chinese poetic forms such as *sh\u012b* (\u8bd7) and *c\u00ed* (\u8bcd). Study the classical structures like the five-character quatrain (*\u4e94\u8a00\u7edd\u53e5*) or the seven-character regulated verse (*\u4e03\u8a00\u5f8b\u8bd7*). Research the specific rules related to tone, rhyme, and parallelism that these forms may require.\n\n2. **Embrace Imagery and Symbolism**: Chinese poetry often uses vivid imagery and symbolism to convey emotions and ideas. Delve into classical Chinese literary symbolism, understanding how natural elements like the moon, mountains, or the lotus flower can carry profound meanings. Use descriptive language to paint clear and evocative pictures in the reader's mind.\n\n3. **Focus on the Theme**: Determine the central theme or emotion you want your poem to convey. Whether it is nature, love, solitude, or social commentary, having a clear focus will guide your word choice and imagery. Explore recurring themes in Chinese poetry, such as the beauty of nature, the ephemerality of life, and the depth of human emotions.\n\n4. **Incorporate Metaphors and Allusions**: Use metaphors and cultural allusions creatively to deepen the layers of meaning in your poem. Referencing Chinese history, classical literature, or ancient philosophies can add richness and depth, resonating with those familiar with the cultural heritage.\n\n5. **Practice Linguistic Precision**: Chinese poetry relies heavily on the precise use of language. Carefully choose words for their sound, tone, and multiple meanings, ensuring each character carries significant weight. Experiment with homophones and tonal variance to add nuanced meaning.\n\n6. **Refine Through Editing**: Write multiple drafts of your poem, paying close attention to cadence, clarity, and the emotional impact of your work. Read it aloud to assess its rhythm and adjust the flow where necessary. Seek feedback from knowledgeable individuals in Chinese poetics to gain perspective on your poem\u2019s effectiveness.\n\n7. **Respect Cultural Elements**: Honor the cultural and historical contexts of the language and poetic form.

Explain the concept of the Earth's tilt \u2013 how the Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. Use a globe or an illustration to show how this tilt causes different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times of the year. Make sure to emphasize that this variation in sunlight is the primary reason we have seasons. For instance, when the North Pole is tilted towards the sun, it's summertime in the Northern Hemisphere, and when it's tilted away, it's wintertime. Use seasons that are familiar to the students, like summer and winter, and describe how this affects things they know, like weather, daylight hours, and activities.

Establishing a strong foundation in behavior and relationship is essential for your puppy\u2019s growth. Here are some effective training techniques, resource suggestions, and tips for managing common issues:\n\n### Positive Reinforcement Training:\n\n1. **Treat-Based Rewards**: Use small treats immediately after your puppy exhibits the desired behavior. This will associate the reward with the action, encouraging repetition.\n\n2. **Verbal Cues**: Introduce simple verbal commands that signal to your puppy what behavior to display. Keep cues short and consistent.\n\n3. **Physical Praise**: Gentle petting or gentle strokes can reinforce good behavior, providing your puppy with attention and affection.\n\n### Housebreaking:\n\n1. **Schedule and Routine**: Establish a consistent schedule for feeding and bathroom breaks. Take your puppy out frequently, especially after eating or waking from a nap.\n\n2. **Designate Potty Area**: Choose a specific spot or area where you want your puppy to go. Consistency in this will help them learn the command for toileting in one place.\n\n3. **Timing and Cleanliness**: Praise immediately after your puppy goes in the right spot. Remove any remnants of accidents to prevent re-soiling the same area.\n\n### Basic Commands:\n\n1. **\"Sit\" Command**: Hold a treat over your puppy\u2019s head. As they look up, sit down and say \"sit.\" Reward with the treat. Gradually phase out the lure.\n\n2. **\"Stay\" Command**: Start with your puppy in a \"sit\" or \"down\" position. Take a few steps back, then reward them for remaining in position. Progressively increase distance and time.\n\n### Teething:\n\n1. **Teething Toys**: Provide durable toys designed for teething. These help redirect chewing from inappropriate furniture to acceptable alternatives.\n\n2. **Frozen Treats**: Offer frozen carrots or teething rings for relief from pain and irritation.\n\n3. **Gum Massage**: Gently rub your puppy\u2019s gums with your finger. This can be soothing and comforting.\n\n### Additional Resources:\n\n- **Books**: \"Positive Puppy Raising\" by Pam Brine, \"Puppy Raising 101\" by Karen Pryor.\n- **Online Courses**: Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, or Karen Pryor Academy offer comprehensive puppy training courses.\n- **Veterinary Consultations**: Regular check-ins with your veterinarian can offer age-specific advice and ensure your puppy's health.\n\n### Tips:\n\n- Be patient and consistent in training.

Before beginning, ensure you have purchased a toilet model that appropriately fits your bathroom's dimension and plumbing setup. Also, gather all necessary tools and materials, including a wrench, a screwdriver, a wax ring, bolts, a water supply line, a level, plumber's tape, a bucket, sponges, and caulk. \n\n1. **Remove the Old Toilet:** Turn off the water supply at the shut-off valve, usually located near the toilet's base. Flush the toilet to drain as much water as possible from the tank and bowl. Use a sponge and a bucket to soak up any remaining water. Disconnect the water supply line using a wrench. Remove the nuts from the bolts at the toilet base with a wrench, then gently rock the toilet to break the seal and lift it away. Place the old toilet on a tarp to avoid spills or drips on your floor. \n\n2. **Prepare the Flange:** Check the flange on the floor for damage; repair or replace it if necessary. Scrape away any old wax with a putty knife, taking care not to damage the flange or surrounding floor. \n\n3. **Install the Wax Ring:** Place the new wax ring flat side down on the floor flange or on the toilet outlet. Consider warming the wax ring slightly to make it more pliable if it is a chilly day. \n\n4. **Set the New Toilet:** Carefully lift the new toilet bowl over the flange, ensuring the bolts protrude through the mounting holes in the base. Gently lower it onto the wax ring to create a seal. Press down evenly until the toilet base sits flush with the floor. Secure the toilet by tightening the nuts onto the bolts, alternating from side to side to prevent any tilting or uneven pressure. Reattach the tank if it was removed for installation and secure it by tightening the bolts.\n\n5. **Connect the Water Supply:** Attach the water supply line to the toilet tank and tighten securely. Turn on the shut-off valve and allow the tank to fill, checking for leaks around the base and at the water connection. \n\n6. **Ensure Stability and Finish Up:** Use a level to ensure the toilet is even. If necessary, insert toilet shims around the base. Tighten any loose nuts, but avoid over-tightening to prevent damage to the porcelain. Apply a bead of caulk around the toilet base for a clean finish and further stability. \n\n7. **Test Your Installation:** Flush the toilet several times to verify proper operation and check carefully for any leaks around the base and water connections.\n\nBy adhering to these steps, you'll ensure a leak-proof, steady installation that functions efficiently. Always prioritize safety by wearing gloves and safety glasses, and consult local plumbing codes if required for compliance.

La caf\u00e9ine est un stimulateur du syst\u00e8me nerveux qui se trouve naturellement dans certains aliments et boissons comme le caf\u00e9, le th\u00e9 et le chocolat.

Adding these together gives a total of around 138 calories from fats, 14 calories from proteins, and 16 calories from carbohydrates, summing up to approximately 168 calories from macronutrients alone.\\n\\nAdditionally, there might be small amounts of dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, which though offering many health benefits, contribute minimally to the caloric count. The calorie count of 396 for a 32-gram serving suggests that the calculation might have included other nutrients or factors, such as secondary metabolites, which are present in small quantities but enhance nutritional value without significantly impacting the calorie count.\\n\\nServing sizes like 32 grams are standardized to provide a consistent basis for nutritional labeling. These sizes allow consumers to understand the nutritional impact of a particular food while enabling manufacturers to compare the nutritional content of similar products. For dietary planning, these labels help individuals maintain a balanced diet by ensuring they know exactly how many calories, fats, sugars, and salts they are consuming.\"}"}

4-stroke engines are, and how they operate.\n\n**2-stroke engines:**\n\n2-stroke engines are types of powerplants that complete a power cycle with just two strokes of the piston, or two revolutions, within the crankshaft. the first stroke is called the power stroke, where combustion occurs, and the second stroke is the exhaust stroke, where exhaust gases are pushed out. this simplicity allows for a higher power-to-weight ratio, making them lightweight and powerful for their size.\n\nthe power cycle of a 2-stroke engine is as follows:\n1. **compression**: the piston compresses the air-fuel mixture in the cylinder.\n2. **power**: the spark plug ignites the mixture, pushing the piston down and creating power.\n3. **exhaust**: on the return up, the piston pushes the burned gases out.\n4. **recharge**: as the piston returns up again, a new charge is drawn into the cylinder via the reed valve or duct, readied for the next power cycle.\n\n2-stroke engines are known for their efficiency in converting fuel energy into power, due to fewer components and less friction. however, they are less efficient in using fuel overall, as they burn more fuel for the same work compared to 4-stroke engines. another drawback is higher emissions, as they burn more fuel without fully burning the mixture, producing more pollutants.\n\n2-stroke engines are commonly used in applications where power-to-weight ratio is crucial, such as in motorcycles, lawn care equipment, and certain types of aeroplane engines. they are relatively easy to maintain and repair, as well as being less expensive.\n\n**4-stroke engines:**\n\n4-stroke engines, on the other hand, complete a power cycle in four strokes of the piston, or four revolutions, within the crankshaft. the cycle includes intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes.\n\nthe power cycle of a 4-stroke engine is as follows:\n1. **intake**: draw in a mixture of air and fuel.\n2. **compression**: compress the air-fuel mixture.\n3. **power**: ignite the mixture with a spark plug to push the piston down, creating power.\n4. **exhaust**: push the burned gases out as the piston returns up.\n\n4-stroke engines are more complex and have more components, which means more friction and heat loss, affecting efficiency. however, they are more fuel-efficient in the long run and produce fewer emissions because they burn fuel more effectively. they require two crankshaft revolutions to complete the cycle, making them heavier and less powerful in the same size compared to 2-stroke engines.\n\n4-stroke engines are
