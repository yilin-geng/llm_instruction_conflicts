I could enjoy ice cream from a variety of brands when I was young, however as I became older I realized that many ice creams do not agree with my stomach. Many contain a lot of sugar and are very high in calories. My business partner also understood this. \n\nYears later when my business partner and I were reminiscing about cold treats that we enjoyed when we were younger, we knew we wanted to design a cold treat that was both delicious and low glycemic. We knew our cold treat had to be made by using low glycemic ingredients like fresh fruit and nuts, as these are very gentle on a person's stomach. We devoted two years of our lives to research and development,  testing many different flavors.

Have you ever wondered how the internet came to be and how it has become such an integral part of our daily lives? Let's take a journey through the history of the internet and explore its impact on our world.\n\n**The Early Days**\n\nThe internet was first conceived in the 1960s by the United States Department of Defense as a way to communicate with other computers. It was called ARPANET, and it was the first network to use packet switching, a method of transmitting data between computers. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, allowing different computer networks to communicate with each other.\n\n**The World Wide Web**\n\nIn 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, making it easy for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. This revolutionized the way we access information and communicate with each other. The internet was no longer just for government and academic use; it was now open to the public.\n\n**The Internet Boom**\n\nIn the 1990s, the internet experienced a massive boom, with the number of users growing exponentially. This was largely due to the development of user-friendly web browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. Suddenly, people could easily access the internet from their homes, schools, and workplaces.\n\n**Social Media and Beyond**\n\nIn the early 2000s, social media platforms like MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter emerged, changing the way we interact with each other. We could now share our thoughts, photos, and videos with people all over the world. This has greatly impacted the way we communicate, making it faster and more convenient.\n\n**How the Internet Has Impacted Our Lives**\n\nThe internet has had a profound impact on our lives, from communication and education to entertainment and business... Although we must remember managing our online experience as just one of many aspects of our life.", "evaluation": {"conflict_recognized": 0.0, "primary_constraint_met": 1.0, "secondary_constraint_met": 0.0, "joint_satisfaction": 0.0, "conflict_name": "keyword_forbidden_conflict: awesome_need"}}

The internet has come a long way since its inception, and its impact on our lives has been immense.\n\nThe internet's history dates back to the 1960s when the United States Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funded a project to create a network of computers that could communicate with each other. This project, called ARPANET, was the first operational packet switching network, and it paved the way for the modern internet.\n\nIn the 1980s, the internet started to expand beyond the military and academic circles. The Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, allowing different networks to communicate with each other and forming a single, global network. The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, making it easier for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks.\n\nThe widespread adoption of the internet in the 1990s transformed the way we communicate, access information, and entertain ourselves. Email, instant messaging, and social media platforms became an integral part of our daily lives. The internet enabled us to connect with people from all over the world, regardless of geographical distance.\n\nThe internet has also had a significant impact on education, healthcare, and commerce. Online learning platforms, video conferencing tools, and e-commerce websites have made it possible for us to learn, work, and shop remotely. The internet has opened up new opportunities for entrepreneurs, artists, and creators to showcase their work and reach a global audience.\n\nHowever, the internet also has its downsides. Cyberbullying, online harassment, and the spread of misinformation are some of the concerns that we need to be aware of. It's essential to use the internet responsibly and follow best practices to stay safe online.\n\nIn conclusion, the internet has revolutionized our lives in countless ways.

When it comes to the consumption of caffeine, moderation is essential. Consuming 100 grams of pure caffeine can indeed be extremely hazardous and potentially fatal.\n\nThe lethal dose of caffeine in humans is estimated to be about 10 grams per 70 kilograms of body weight. Consuming 100 grams would greatly surpass this amount, causing severe and possibly irreversible damage to your organs.\n\nIngestion of such a massive amount of caffeine would lead to excessive heart rate and palpitations, as well as muscle spasms, anxiety, and seizures. The nervous system may get severely affected, potentially leading to paralysis and eventual death.\n\nHowever, please note that it is extremely rare for someone to ingest such a high dose of caffeine due to the intense bitter taste, but reckless behavior can still put one's life at risk.\n\nSo, always remember to enjoy your caffeinated beverages in moderation, as going overboard can have drastic consequences.", "evaluation": {"conflict_recognized": 0.0, "primary_constraint_met": 1.0, "secondary_constraint_met": 0.0, "joint_satisfaction": 0.0, "conflict_name": "keyword_frequency_conflict: like_5_2"}}

However, this policy applies only to companies with 50+ employees, and many workers don't qualify or can't afford unpaid leave.\n\n**Constraint 2 Answer**\n\nThe United States has one of the least comprehensive maternity leave policies among developed countries. The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is the primary federal law governing maternity leave. It requires companies with 50 or more employees to provide eligible workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons, including childbirth.\n\nDespite the existence of the FMLA, many working mothers in the U.S. face significant challenges in balancing work and family responsibilities. The policy has several limitations, including:\n\n1. **Eligibility:** To be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the company for at least 12 months and completed 1,250 hours of service in the 12 months preceding the leave.\n2. **Unpaid leave:** The FMLA does not provide any paid leave, which can create significant financial burdens for workers who need to take time off.\n3. **Company size:** The FMLA only applies to companies with 50 or more employees, leaving many workers in small businesses or startups without access to maternity leave.\n4. **Limited duration:** The FMLA only provides up to 12 weeks of leave, which may not be sufficient for many mothers, particularly those with complicated pregnancies or births.\n\nAs a result, many working mothers in the U.S. are forced to rely on other sources of income, such as disability benefits, vacation time, or unpaid leave, to care for their newborns. Some states and companies have implemented more comprehensive maternity leave policies, but these vary widely, and there is no federal standard for paid family leave.\n\nIn comparison, many developed countries offer significantly more generous maternity leave policies, including paid leave and more comprehensive benefits. For example, the United Kingdom provides up to 39 weeks of paid maternity leave, while Canada offers up to 52 weeks of paid leave.\n\nEfforts to reform the U.S. maternity leave policy have been ongoing for several years. Some lawmakers have proposed legislation to provide paid family leave and expand the FMLA to cover more workers. However, these efforts have been met with resistance from some business groups and policymakers who argue that implementing paid family leave would be too costly and burdensome for employers.\n\nIn conclusion, the U.S. maternity leave policy is limited and inadequate, falling short of international standards. The FMLA provides some protections for eligible workers, but its limitations leave many working mothers without access to paid family leave or adequate time to care for their newborns.", "evaluation": {"conflict_recognized": 1.0, "primary_constraint_met": 0.0, "secondary_constraint_met": 1.0, "joint_satisfaction": 0.0, "conflict_name": "word_length_conflict: 300_50"}}

Voici les \u00e9tapes \u00e0 suivre :\n\n1. \u00c9valuation des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts : Il est crucial d'\u00e9valuer l'\u00e9tendue des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts pour d\u00e9terminer la gravit\u00e9 de la situation et planifier les r\u00e9parations en cons\u00e9quence. Il faudra inspecter la coque, les superstructures, les moteurs et les syst\u00e8mes \u00e9lectriques pour identifier les dommages.\n\n2. S\u00e9curisation du navire : Assurez-vous que le navire est s\u00e9curis\u00e9 et ancr\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re stable pour \u00e9viter tout mouvement qui pourrait aggraver les d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. Si n\u00e9cessaire, utilisez des amarres et des ancres pour stabiliser le navire.\n\n3. Drainage de l'eau : Si le navire a pris de l'eau, il faut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 son drainage pour pr\u00e9venir toute consolidation des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts et r\u00e9duire le poids qui p\u00e8se sur la coque. Utilisez les pompes du navire ou appelez des \u00e9quipes de secours si n\u00e9cessaire.\n\n4. R\u00e9paration de la coque : Une fois que le navire est s\u00e9curis\u00e9 et que l'eau a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vacu\u00e9e, vous pouvez commencer \u00e0 r\u00e9parer la coque. Il faudra probablement remplacer les plaques de m\u00e9tal endommag\u00e9es ou les r\u00e9parer avec des mat\u00e9riaux de calfatage appropri\u00e9s.\n\n5. R\u00e9vision des syst\u00e8mes critiques : Apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9par\u00e9 la coque, il est essentiel de v\u00e9rifier les syst\u00e8mes critiques tels que les moteurs, les pompes, les g\u00e9n\u00e9rateurs et les syst\u00e8mes \u00e9lectriques pour s'assurer qu'ils fonctionnent correctement.\n\n6. Tests et v\u00e9rifications : Avant de remettre le navire en service, il est essentiel de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 des tests et des v\u00e9rifications pour s'assurer que tout fonctionne normalement et que le navire est s\u00e9curitaire pour reprendre la mer.\n\nEn suivant ces \u00e9tapes et en prenant les pr\u00e9cautions n\u00e9cessaires, vous pourrez r\u00e9parer la coque d'un navire s\u00e9v\u00e8rement endommag\u00e9 lors d'une temp\u00eate et le remettre en \u00e9tat de naviguer en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9.", "evaluation": {"conflict_recognized": 1.0, "primary_constraint_met": 1.0, "secondary_constraint_met": 0.0, "joint_satisfaction": 0.0, "conflict_name": "language_conflict: en_fr"}}

The police are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the death, which has left friends and family stunned.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the victim, identified as John Smith, was a reclusive individual who kept to himself. Neighbors reported that they had not seen him in days, but assumed he was just his usual introverted self.\n\n\"I thought he was just one of those guys who liked his alone time,\" said Jane Doe, a neighbor who lived next door to Smith. \"But when I saw the police cars outside his house, I knew something was wrong.\"\n\nThe police were called to the scene after a concerned friend, who had not heard from Smith in weeks, decided to check in on him. Upon entering the house, they found Smith's lifeless body in the living room.\n\nWhile the police have not released any official statements on the cause of death, sources close to the investigation suggest that it may be related to a pre-existing medical condition. However, the authorities are still trying to piece together the events leading up to Smith's demise.\n\nAs the investigation continues, the community is left with more questions than answers. \"It's just so shocking,\" said Sarah Johnson, a local resident. \"You never think something like this could happen in your own backyard.\"\n\nThe police are urging anyone with information to come forward and assist in the investigation.\n\n Critique:\n\nThe story is well-structured and effectively conveys the mysterious circumstances surrounding the man's death. However, there are a few areas that could be improved. Firstly, the use of vague terms such as \"bizarre incident\" and \"pre-existing medical condition\" does not provide much clarity to the reader. More specific details would help to create a clearer picture of the events.\n\nAdditionally, the inclusion of quotes from neighbors and local residents adds a human touch to the story, but some of the quotes feel a bit generic. For example, the quote from Sarah Johnson (\"It's just so shocking...\") could be replaced with something more insightful or revealing.\n\nOverall, the story effectively sparks the reader's curiosity and raises questions about the circumstances surrounding the man's death. However, more detailed information and specific quotes would help to create a more engaging and informative article.\n\nNote: I tried to recreate the story following the first constraint but as it demanded me 'to not include the keywords **awesome** and **need**' and later it also asked to 'include the keywords **awesome** and **need**', I changed none.", "evaluation": {"conflict_recognized": 1.0, "primary_constraint_met": 1.0, "secondary_constraint_met": 0.0, "joint_satisfaction": 0.0, "conflict_name": "keyword_forbidden_conflict: awesome_need"}}
